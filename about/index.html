  <h2>Oh hi, how are you? Good? Awesome.</h2>
  <h3>My name is Joe Tower. I craft user-focused experiences.</h3>

<div class="page about">

  <div class="overview">
    <p>I live in the Nokomis Neighborhood of Minneapolis, MN, with a lady and two dogs. I am a print designer, turned web designer, turned front-end developer, turned wannabe programmer (trying to do it all). During the day I work as a designer and frontend engineer for <a href="http://fourkitchens.com" title="Four Kitchens">Four Kitchens</a>. In my free time, I am the Chief Designer for <a href="http://lightbomber.com" title="Lightbomber">Lightbomber</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>I want the internet to be: beautiful to look at, as open-source as possible, and above all else, user-friendly.</blockquote>

    <p>I am a film nerd, Drupal lover, music snob, and occasional video game player. When it comes to food I am vegetable obsessed and prefer savory to sweet. Beer, scotch, and gin are my favorite alcholic beverages.</p>
