## Chelsea Wolfe - Abyss

This is my favorite Chelsea Wolfe record to date. It's also her most *full-sounding* record. It flows well and I can't think of one inferior track.

**I'm digging these tracks:** _Carrion Flowers_, _Iron Moon_, and _Crazy Love_.

## Ghost - Meliora

I'm surprised at how much I enjoy this record. Ghost's first two records felt off to me - in different ways. 2010's **Opus Eponymous** felt just too serious and like they were trying too hard. Also, revisiting it now, it felt far less immediate and _full-sounding_. I found the whole

2012's **Infestissumam** felt too much like spooky carnival comedy to me. I know that's a weird description. The organs are super awesome, as always, but this record still sounds like Ghost trying to find their voice.

Both previous albums were slower, more sparsely layered; less driving/dynamic/epic. Whatever Ghost changed, man, I love it. **Meliora** is just plain fun to me. The awesome organs are still here. The cheesy-at-times vocals are present. The whole package is more refined, more full, more fun, and just awesome.


**I'm digging these tracks:** _Spirit_, _Cirice_, and _Majesty_.

## Tribulation - The Children of the Night

These guys are crazy. This record, like their previous one, is an interesting blend of thrash, death, and black metal. I haven't heard their debut, 2009's **The Horror** but will do so when I can purchase it digitally. I'm really into this album, and it might end up being my favorite metal record of the year.
