## Marriages - Salome

I'm a fan of **Red Sparrows**, so this debut record by two of their members comes with some high expectations. I'm pretty into this.

**I'm digging these tracks:** _The liar_, _Santa Sangre_, and _Salome_.

## Earl Sweatshirt - I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside: An Album by Earl Sweatshirt

Earl is as impressive as ever, if not more so. The lazy flow, dense lyrics, wrapped up in superb delivery. The production is scratchy and distorts all over itself. I think this will be a grower. This is an incredible year for hip-hop already.

**I'm digging these tracks:** _Huey_, _Mantra_, _Faucet_, and _Wool_.

## Jamie xx

I've mildly enjoyed **The XX**'s two full length releases; which, in contrast are way more down-tempo and monotone. Beautiful, yes, but full of more lows than highs. Jamie xx's debut record takes the best parts of the xx's sound and mixes it in with seriously more up-tempo beats. I'm a fan.
