## Marriages - Salome

The liar. Santa Sangre. Salome.

## Earl Sweatshirt - I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside: An Album by Earl Sweatshirt

Several listens in and I'm not into this as much as his debut. The production is scratchy and seems to distort itself. I'm hoping this is a grower.

## Jamie xx

I've mildly enjoyed **The XX**'s two full length releases; which, in contrast are way more down-tempo and monotone. Beautiful, yes, but full of more lows than highs. Jamie xx's debut record takes the best parts of the xx's sound and mixes it in with some more up-tempo pieces. I'm a fan.
