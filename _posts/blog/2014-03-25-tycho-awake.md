I've been listening to this record more consistently than anything else released this year, so far.

## Awake is:

### Great for running / exercise
Some electronic music (very generalized genre description, I know) intrinsically has the ability to showcase peaks and valleys, rhythmic rise and fall, and hypnotic comfort grooves. **Tycho** has mastered this, and the universal appeal of his music is testament enough.

### The best for designing _and_ coding. what!

It just is.

### The best driving music

Go ahead, get in your car, start this record up on repeat, and drive.
