## A Case of You
Joni had a way with words. I find the lines used for the focus of this wallpaper to be especially great. And while I will always adore <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YuaZcylk_o" title="Joni Mitchell - A Case of You studio version on Youtube">her version</a>, my actual reason behind creating this was James Blake.

Last year James Blake covered this song as part of his *Enough Thunder* EP. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJDSueNSMJE" title="James Blake - A Case of You">His version</a> rekindled my admiration for this beautiful song. The emphasis, vibrato, and overall inflection James uses bring a whole new vulnerability to Joni's words. I've been obsessed since the first time I heard it. The way James Blake sings these particular lyrics leaves me in a bit of awe.

Joni brought the unique sound of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_dulcimer" title="Appalachian dulcimer on Wikipedia">Appalachian dulcimer</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAsXMlkwXgs" title="Joni Mitchell - A Case of You Live on Youtube">her version</a>. James Blake brings the same kind of somewhat off-kilter playing to the piano. Both are effective executions.

Another favorite lyrical passage is (mainly for the drawn-out vibrato "I"):
>I am a lonely painter, I live in a box of paints, I'm frightened by the devil, and drawn to those who ain't afraid.

Which beautifully weaves into the very passage chosen for this edition of Typography in Music
