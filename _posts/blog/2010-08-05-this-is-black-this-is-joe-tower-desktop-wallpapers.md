Continuing with my last post, more desktop wallpapers. These were created during a half-hour break at work. Callin was especially hating-on my wallpapers that day and I just couldn't stand for it. He had to be muzzled. The wallpapers are at the end of this post. (oh, the suspense)

## This is Black
Keeping with the theme of desktop minimalism, I wanted a straight black wallpaper. It was to be so black that it actually said "This is Black". Well, in all actuality it became more than black but the theme still comes across. I think, anyway. Textured, letter-pressed "This is Black".

## This is Joe Tower
This is not me Joe Tower (this website, me), this is <a href="http://www.lastageblog.com/joe-tower/" title="Joe Tower (The Actor)">Joe Tower (the actor)</a> Joe Tower. He bumped into me a few months back (on the internets, same name, keep up) and is now in Minneapolis (where I live) for a summer residency at the <a href="http://www.guthrietheater.org/" title="Link: Guthrie Theater Website">Guthrie Theater</a>. I haven't met Joe Tower yet but we are friends on Facebook. I do want to meet him before he returns to California. We are only 10 minutes or so away from each other. I can almost feel another Joe Tower being Joe Tower. Wait, a whale is in trouble......*

## The Story
In an effort to meet Joe Tower (the actor), I thought it might be fun to freak him out a bit and make a desktop wallpaper depicting his severed head and the text "This is Joe Tower". So, hey Joe, this wallpaper is for you!

Wait, that isn't the real story. I'm sorry Joe. The real story is that Callin (co-worker, keep up) is an angry demon and possessed my body. He (as me as him) opened up Photoshop and made this my desktop background. He plans to use his power for evil. I must kill Callin before he destroys the world in an "accidental", self-inflicted, "spontaneous" combustion that destroys most of New York City. Wait, that was the first season of Heroes. Spoiler alert! (in that scenario, I would be Hiro)

Damnit, the real story just isn't as interesting. My co-workers have really embraced the presence of another Joe Tower in the world, let alone in our city. They are mildly fascinated in the prospect of me meeting another Joe Tower (not a common name like Chris Hansen). I'm conflicted because I don't want another Joe Tower stealing my comedic thunder and unleashing it on the world. I also don't want him to murder me for my name. I should welcome my co-workers interest and respect, as flattery and a testament to my award-winning character. Whoa, simmer down now lil' guy. Sorry, that was out-of-line and totally too self-centered and downright self-indulgently self-serving. As Tim says, "if the shoe fits, I live in the 80's". That makes no sense, but it actually does. Seriously, I can be a humorous kind of dude (like Joe Tower (the actor)). 

Anyway, this was created (and displayed) to make my co-workers laugh and do a double-take when they pass by my monitor. That's it. It's not too creepy, right? Joe Tower stares at Joe Tower staring at Joe Tower, all day Joe Tower, Joe Tower. I'm glad that ended.
