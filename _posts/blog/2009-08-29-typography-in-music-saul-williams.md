## Tao of Now
**Saul Stacey Williams** is one of the most important writers/poets in the world today. His words inspire and bring redefinition to the love of language. His spoken word and four published books of poetry have touched me in a profound way over the last 8 years or so. His music, while interesting, doesn't carry the impact of his poetry, his naked, unaccompanied voice. His debut album, 2001's "_**Amethyst Rockstar**_" was earth-shattering to me. I will always remember the day I purchased it, sitting in my car, blaring the entire album - with my mouth open, in awe of what my ears were hearing, experiencing. I even called my buddy Warn and tried to play him "_Tao Of Now_" over the phone. To this day, that song in particular, always has the same impact on me.

Saul has stated that he felt like he had a lot to prove with his debut album, and he did, _and he did_. I only wish his last three releases had the same impact on me. He still writes some great material but I don't _feel_ the overall direction he's moving. Regardless, he is a man who deserves recognition and should be talked about more.

Saul also had a profound starring role, in the 1998 film "**Slam**", alongside fellow spoken word genius **Beau Sia** (_of HBO's Def Jam Poetry fame and a 2 time winner of the National Poetry Slam_). I think the most memorable scene in the film goes without saying, if you've seen it you know what's up. The brilliant courtyard "words instead of fists" scene. This was Ray Joshua's (Saul) breaking point in the film, the pinnacle, the defining moment of the world around him. He freed himself with that speech and dammit, I still get goose bumps every time I watch it.

Saul has books filled with insightful, witty, highly-quotable passages. Many of which, I'd be inspired to explore typographically. Perhaps the first one that struck me and stayed firmly etched in my brain, came from his book "_**She**_" (1999). Perhaps I'm a romantic at heart or just more in touch with my emotions than the average dude, but these words hold a significant place in my love for hip-hop, music, poetry, language and she.

Once a week or so, I plan on exploring various avenues of typography utilizing my favorite lyrics. Mainly because it fulfills a cross-section of design, the bridge between music and design, my two biggest passions. Also, because I love type and always need to evolve, take-in all I can from experience. Each piece will reflect a particular artist and give a brief overview, for the uninitiated.

The results of these may not be anything special, or this one in particular, but my goal is to push the way I think about type. I'm a fan of clean type but I also get down with more imperfect hand-lettering, which might end up being my main tool in these little exercises. I have visions in my head of arranging these profound words, as you often see, in motion - big, grand, spectacular typography in motion, Flash style. Well, my goals aren't geared toward video right now, but my vision isn't far off.

I will share them here for anyone who might be inspired to do the same or happens to enjoy what the process of examining type.

As always, thanks for reading.
