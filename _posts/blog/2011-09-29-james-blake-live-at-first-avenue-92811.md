Blake's performance last night impressed me to an extent. Over the last year I've kept an eye on his live performances circulating on Youtube, which earlier in the year left a lot to be desired. Over the past 6 months he's improved greatly in confidence, delivery, and overall performance. So naturally, when I found out he was coming to Minneapolis I had to see him. The self-titled album has been in constant rotation since before its official release - yes, I illegally downloaded it. But, I purchased the album on Vinyl and CD. That's how I roll. This album is too good not to own and drool over.

Also over the course of the year I've read-through various U.K. forum posts about Blake. Having started out as a dubstep DJ playing clubs, the U.K. club scene folk seem to largely despise Blake's evolution into more accessible territory. I oppose this distain because I wouldn't find Blake as compelling if he hadn't transitioned into singing. I've listened to quite a few mixes he put together from his sample-heavy days and, while interesting, don't carry-through what I see in Blake's voice as an artist. I think his evolution has progressed perfectly. He still composes abstract, noise-influenced, pulsating, and largely off-putting music. It's just that now he gets to include his own voice, instead of countless other artist's voices - it is more personal. I've always had a passion for music with harsh moments contrasted by the beautiful. Also, music that aches of vulnerability. I'm a sensitive man, I guess.

## Venue is key
First Avenue has a rich history, being the pride of Minneapolis' music scene and well-toured venue for countless big name acts. However, it isn't the first venue I'd think of as being a suitable fit for Blake's music. He needs an intimate setting, sit-down preferable - especially considering his performance's lack of visuals. It gets boring just standing around watching. I brought Nicholas with me, as I figured he'd dig Blake's compositions and keyboard use. We both agreed that it would've been far more enjoyable, and comfortable, had the venue been different. Perhaps one of the following would've been a better fit: Varsity Theater (possibly too small), The Dakota, or even The Guthrie (would've been incredible). I wish I had seen Blake when he performed some months back at The Entry.

## The performance
Blake started out with *Unluck* and moved through much of his self-titled release, and a few new songs. The clear highlight for me was *The Wilhelm Scream*. Somewhere toward the middle of the track, Blake's vocals opened-up and surrounded, or rather, enveloped the venue. It was the strongest moment, vocal-wise, of the show. Absolute perfection.

He played a more drawn-out rendition of the classic *Limit to Your Love* **Feist** tune that unraveled into straight-up reggae dub territory. It was pretty rad. His live sampling during *I never Learnt To Share* was incredible as well - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqY2qcQYjy0" title="Live Sampled I Never Learnt to Share">Watch a recent similar performance on Youtube</a>.

## Looking forward
On October 10th Blake will release a new EP titled <a href="http://prettymuchamazing.com/music/stream/james-blake-enough-thunder-kcrw-session" title="James Blake - Enough Thunder">Enough Thunder</a>. Of the 6 new songs offered, *Fall Creek Boys Choir* features none other than <a href="http://boniver.org/" title="Bon Iver">Bon Iver</a>. This is a match made in eargasmic bliss. I'd love to hear a full-length collaboration between these similarly-minded artists. I'm not fully on-board with all the auto-tune nonsense these gentleman choose to utilize. I know they both have incredible voices, so I have to ask why it's necessary? My guess would be that it's just how *they* hear the song playing out in their head. It's still a wonderful track.

**Listen to** *Fall Creek Boys Choir*

It appears the majority of **Enough Thunder** has leaked-out onto the internet, in studio or live form. It sounds to be a diverse release in terms of musical styles - much like his self-titled album. I'm stoked.

## In closing
The opportunity to see Blake was not lost. It further cemented my interest in him as an artist. As I tend to say about several artists, I look forward to hearing what he does next. Cool story bro.
