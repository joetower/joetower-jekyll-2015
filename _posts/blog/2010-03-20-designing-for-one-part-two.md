_Preface: Since I’m a designer I have a hard time owning digital albums without having quality associated artwork. I love seeing iTunes filled with awesome artwork which then fills my screen when my screen saver comes on. OK, I’m a big ass nerd who likes to design stuff and uses any oppor­tunity to do so. I figured, hey I should post something, so here you go. Most of these are quick 30 minute design exercises that I do not agonize over. I do however, find great pleasure in creating them._

### Grieves featuring P.O.S. - War For The Crippled (single)
I've been obsessed with this song and P.O.S' verse in particular since the <a href="http://www.fifthelementonline.com/grievesmrmodest.html" class="external" title="Buy the EP">Confessions of Mr. Modest EP</a> was released - coinciding with the re-release of <a href="http://www.fifthelementonline.com/grieves88keys.html" class="external" title="Buy 88 Keys and Counting">88 Keys and Counting</a> and Grieves' own induction into the <a href="http://rhymesayers.com/grieves" class="external" title="Rhymesayers Entertainment">Rhymesayers</a> family. I've done a few design-related things to get it out of my system - mainly revolving around P.O.S' slightly whispered lyrics "_How come your eyes hurt me so bad_". So I played with it. Nothing super involved but I dig it and think it fits in with the EP's album cover, in my own way at least.

### Aesop Rock - Music For Earthworms
So I said I'd do this someday and now is that some day. It is very similar in style to the Appleseed cover. Again, relying heavily on the main image. I definitely dig it more than the old school original cover. Imagery utilized from <a href="http://www.shorpy.com" title="Shorpy High Resolution Old World Photos" class="external">Shorpy</a>.

### Waterbear - Untitled But Moustached Lady
This is seriously just for fun and is absolutely ridiculous. Nicholas and Tom need to put out an album and maybe this in some small way will help them along their way - motivation. If you're reading this stop and go make some music. Put down the fish and beans. Stop shitting your pants, wearing wild life sweaters and make some music.
