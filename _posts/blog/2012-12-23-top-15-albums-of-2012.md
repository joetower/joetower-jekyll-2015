## #15 Twin Shadow - Confess
![#15 Twin Shadow - Confess]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/15-twin-shadow-confess.jpg)

### Listen to "*Five Seconds*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/51888563&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false"> </iframe>

I'm not sure how I missed George Lewis Jr.'s debut record, 2010's **Forget**, but I'm glad I didn't miss this one. He isn't saying anything profound, lyrically. But he breathes new life into 80s music stylings, giving enough of a twist to seem relevant today. People have compared his voice to **Morrissey**, which is totally accurate. I also would compare him to **Prince** (listen to *I Don't Care*). Lewis also shows off a strong **Bowie** influence throughout (I think of *Cat People (Putting Out Fire)*).

My love for this album is entirely superficial. I love the 80s throwback atmosphere; particularly the synthesizers, which are all kinds of awesome. I adore the more out-of-place moments too, like the guitar-driven beat of *You Call Me On*. This is a really fun record.

**Favorite tracks:** *Golden Light*, *You Call Me On*, *The One*, and *I Don't Care*.

## #14 Efterklang - Piramida
![#14 Efterklang - Piramida]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/14-efterklang-piramida.jpg)

### Listen to "*Hollow Mountain*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/56404347&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false"> </iframe>

Efterklang is totally new to me this year. I discovered them through an <a href="http://rdio.com" title="Get Rdio">Rdio</a> recommendation, and man do I dig this record. They remind me of a modern **Talk Talk**, in composition and feel, mixed with a bit of **The National**'s vocal/lyric stylings, and a comparison to **Talking Heads** wouldn't be out of line. I find their intimate compositions very charming, and almost tailor-fit for winter. This is definitely headphone-recommended music.

**Favorite tracks:** *Hollow Mountain*, *Apples*, and *Black Summer*.

## #13 Fiona Apple - The Idler Wheel...
![#13 Fiona Apple - The Idler Wheel...]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/13-fiona-apple-idler-wheel.jpg)

### Listen to "*Hot Knife (remix)*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62792174&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

It's no secret I love Fiona Apple. You could say she has a uniquely negative view of the world - based on the lyrics to pretty much every song she's ever written. She's tortured, odd, and I kind of adore her for all of it. I'll put aside the fact that I find dark, and somewhat disturbed women attractive. This woman can sing, and play the shit out of the piano. Her compositions are jarring, unusual, and always technically astute. Most importantly, she sings and performs with deep conviction - scary conviction. She's unlike any female making music today.

**Favorite tracks:** *Every Single Night*, *Daredevil*, *Jonathan* and *Werewolf*.

* * *

## #12 Neurosis - Honor Found In Decay
![#12 Neurosis - Honor Found In Decay]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/12-neurosis-honor-found-in-decay.jpg)

### Listen to "*We All Rage in Gold*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/71661065&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false"> </iframe>

Any album Neurosis releases will end up on my year end list of favorite albums. It took me years to appreciate their abrasive, and totally inaccessible approach to creating music. Somewhere around **Times Of Grace** their music clicked with me. I wouldn't say they create music for every day consumption, but man, these guys scratch an itch.

**Favorite tracks:** *At The Well*, *My Heart For Deliverance*, and *Casting Of The Ages*.

* * *

## #11 Gojira - L'Enfant Sauvage
![#11 Gojira - L'Enfant Sauvage]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/11-gojira-lenfant-sauvage.jpg)

### Listen to "*Explosia*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/68139000&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false"> </iframe>

Gojira are just flat-out one of my favorite metal bands today. They continue to exude everything I love about metal. Years ago I dismissed them as a **Meshuggah** clone, but man was I foolish. To me, Gojira blows Meshuggah away in almost every way - at least on the basis of Meshuggah's output after *Destroy Erase Improve*. Gojira compose technically impressive arrangements that always throw in a bit of a curve ball. Balls to the wall awesome.

**Favorite tracks:** *L'Enfant Sauvage*, *The Axe*, *The Gift Of Guilt*, and *The Fall*.

* * *

## #10 Polica - Give You The Ghost
![#10 Polica - Give You The Ghost]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/10-polica-give-you-the-ghost.jpg)

### Listen to "*Dark Star*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/22383886&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false"> </iframe>

I wrote about seeing <a href="/2012/08/polica-live-at-the-cabooze-outdoor-plaza-81112" title="Polica Live">Polica</a> live a few months back. That post pretty much sums up the way I feel about them. Their debut record has stuck with me throughout the year, which to me is a big deal.

**Favorite tracks:** *I See My Mother*, *Dark Star*, *The Maker*, and *Lay Your Cards Out*.

* * *

## #9 The Kyteman Orchestra - S/T
![#9 The Kyteman Orchestra - S/T]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/9-the-kyteman-orchestra.jpg)

### Listen to "*The Mushroom Cloud*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/42017624&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false"> </iframe>

Strings, chants, opera, and spoken word. These are elements found on the latest offering from The Kyteman Orchestra. **Colin Benders** has assembled quite the impressive genre-spanning orchestra. The ensemble consists of eighteen musicians, including opera singers and choir members. According to <a href="http://kyteman.com/about" title="Kyteman's Website">their website</a>, all instrumentation on this album was recorded in one take, with little editing. That is an extremely impressive feat.
Lyrically, Bender rhymes about existential topics with a shifting delivery method. He gets filthy on several tracks (*Truth or Dare*, *Angry At The World*). On the opposite end of genre spectrum, *Long Lost Friend* is a slow-paced jazz soul track that builds beautifully. *Angry At The World* has an insane climax that rivals passion found in the world's most aggressive rappers. This is such a massive album; one which demands countless listens to take in. I'm in so much awe. What a diverse monster. I highly recommend this record.

**Favorite tracks:** *Truth Or Dare*, *Angry At The World*, *Long Lost Friend*, and *The Mushroom Cloud*.

## #8 Graveyard - Lights Out
![#8 Graveyard - Lights Out]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/8-graveyard-lights-out.jpg)

### Listen to "*Endless Night*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/64849916&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false"> </iframe>

I've loved everything these guys have put out. **Lights Out** hasn't been as instantly lovable as last year's brilliant **Hisingen Blues**, but it's growing on me.

**Favorite tracks:** *Slow Motion Countdown*, *Endless Night*, *Goliath*, and *Fool in the End*.

* * *

## #7 Katatonia - Dead End Kings
![#7 Katatonia - Dead End Kings]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/7-katatonia-dead-end-kings.jpg)

### Listen to "*Dead Letters*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/51139987&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

Katatonia have had a history of crafting albums that become my go-to jams throughout the winter months. They have pioneered a unique blend of pop-friendly doom metal. It's very much rooted in doom, but has enough polish, and catchy songwriting to be accessible by the masses. For some reason I still love everything these guys put out. **Dead End Kings** doesn't venture outside of charted territory, but continues to hone the brilliant execution of their last two albums **The Great Cold Distance** and **Night Is The New Day**.
Lyrically, there is nothing new here either. All songs continue to revolve around haunting relationships and vaguely depressive feelings, sandwiched between very memorable choruses. **Jonas Renkse's** vocals continue getting better than ever. Katatonia stand out against similar acts because of Renske's vocal ability, and the whole band's collective musicianship. Katatonia have become better than ever at crafting incredibly intricate songs. When you take a close look at their compositions, it's hard to deny just how incredible they are.

**Favorite tracks:** *The Parting*, *The One You Are Looking For Is Not Here*, *The Racing Heart*, and *Leech*.

* * *

## #6 Witchcraft - Legend
![#6 Witchcraft - Legend]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/6-witchcraft-legend.jpg)

### Listen to "*It's Not Because of You*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/54588580&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false"> </iframe>

These guys put out stellar throwback 70s rock. This album is so damn solid. I'm a sucker for sludgy guitars, wicked solos, and higher register rock vocals. I commend Witchcraft for crafting such a concise record full of sexy ass grooves. This record helps gets me through chaotic web design/development days.

**Favorite tracks:** *Flag of Fate*, *It's Not Because Of You*, *Ghost House*, and *White Light Suicide*.

* * *

## #5 Grizzly Bear - Shields
![#5 Grizzly Bear - Shields]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/5-grizzly-bear-shields.jpg)

### Listen to "*Listen and Wait (Bonus)*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117653822&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

Grizzly Bear is the kind of band that make records I love on first listen, but rarely leave a lasting impact. 2009's **Veckatimest** was critically praised, and I dug it quite a bit for a while. At the end of the year it did not make this list. So for me, **Shields** is the best Grizzly Bear record to date. I feel like everything came together. It is still very much an album to play in the background; to zone out to while doing other things. But it also stands up to the headphone listening experience, as an extraordinary record. The production and vocal execution are top notch.

**Favorite tracks:** *Speak in Rounds*, *Yet Again*, *Gun-Shy*, and *Sun In Your Eyes*.

## #4 P.O.S - We Don't Even Live Here
![#4 P.O.S - We Don't Even Live Here]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/4-pos-we-dont-even-live-here.jpg)

### Listen to "*Fuck Your Stuff*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/59488329&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false"> </iframe>

This album was possibly my most anticipated record of the year. After a few listens, I was very underwhelmed. After a few months, I'm still a bit underwhelmed. It has some incredible songs, and some that simply fall a bit short. All things considered, I would be remiss in its exclusion from this list.

It's a difficult task for any musician to follow up such an instant masterpiece as 2009's <a href="/2009/02/pos-never-better-album-review" title="My Review of Never Better">Never Better</a>. P.O.S has made some interesting decisions on this record.
*Bumper* is a solid album opener. *Fuck Your Stuff* is a banger, but could be a bit heavy-handed, lyrically. Whenever rappers start throwing out heaps of bravado about their "crew" I get a bit uncomfortable. *Where We Land* was love at first listen. The lyrics are fantastic. To me, the song is almost like a rap interpretation of the charming 2009 film *Away We Go* - which I really liked. But I'm a romantic at heart, and constantly challenge where I choose to live. I'm always trying to find my place.
*Wanted/Wasted* is equally incredible. The piano chord progression setting up the hook is just perfectly sick. I give props to **Astronautalis** too. Love that guy. *They Can't Come* has a bit more lethargic progression, but I dig it overall. **Sims'** verse is pretty dope, and is another shining example of how far he's come.
*Lock-Picks, Knives, Bricks and Bats* feels like a **Never Better** b-side. It's a great song. I also really dig *Fire In The Hole/Arrow To The Action*.

From this point on it gets a little murky for me. *Get Down* doesn't make me want to get down. It makes me want to skip to the next track. *All Of It* rubs me the wrong way too. *We Don't Even Live Here (Weird Friends)* continues the theme of anxiety laden beats, and full-force barrage of lyrics. The album closer *Piano Hits* continues the erratic pace set by the latter half of the record. I do like this track, and feel it works well as a closer.

So, I guess with the exception of 3 tracks, I really dig this album. It's definitely Stef's most "fun" record to date. While I prefer the more introspective/personal side of P.O.S, I respect how fun he's tried to make this record. It will hold a place in my record collection, but somewhere beneath **Ipecac Neat** and **Never Better**.

**Favorite tracks:** *Where We Land*, *Wanted/Wasted*, *Lock-Picks, Knives, Bricks and Bats*, and *Fire In The Hole/Arrow To The Action*.

## #3 Macklemore & Ryan Lewis - The Heist
![#3 Macklemore & Ryan Lewis - The Heist]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/3-macklemore-ryan-lewis-the-heist.jpg)

### Listen to "*Same Love*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/53266690&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

Their perfectly timed gay marriage anthem *Same Love* made this duo ## 1 on iTunes, and got them the opportunity to reach a national audience with performances on **Ellen** and **Late Night With Jimmy Fallon**. More importantly, it gave these two Shark Face Gang fools the attention of hip-hop lovers everywhere. I couldn't be happier they made it into a global spotlight. They deserve it 100%. **The Heist** is the kind of debut record artists dream about making. *Thrift Shop* is a hispter's anthem, but carries enough charm for me to bump it and not be ashamed. The beat is out of control. *Same Love* could be the definitive gay marriage anthem, and I wholly agree with its message.
*Neon Cathedral* battles alcoholism with its parody of a bar being his church. These guys are full of energy, positive messages, and pretty excellent production. Ryan Lewis murders every beat on this monster of an album. I have to hand it to all the guest spots too. Every single one is just destroyed - from *Same Love*'s **Mary Lambert** to **Allen Stone's** soulful execution on *Neon Cathedral*. I love this record, hard.

**Favorite tracks:** *Can't Hold Us*, *Thrift Shop*, *Same Love*, and *Neon Cathedral*.

* * *

## #2 Aesop Rock - Skelethon
![#2 Aesop Rock - Skelethon]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/2-aesop-rock-skelethon.jpg)

### Listen to "*Cycles To Gehenna*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/57063793&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false"> </iframe>

Skelethon is one crazy ride of an album. I'd say it's his most ambitious record to date. He is still the "**David Lynch** of this rap shit" - as I describe him. I've said it before, but Aesop's strength as a lyricist has everything to do with how abstractly he writes. At times, strings of fragmented thoughts fly by ignored, and other times those same passages will stick with you. Aesop is not necessarily recommended for a casual hip-hop fan, and people can be off-put by his verbose strings of diarrhea rap. I've always lapped that shit up (how's that for a disgusting pun?).
If you can keep up with some of his (more clearly defined) storytelling-driven narratives, there are a plethora of rewards to be found. This can be a difficult task, given how densely packed each track is (*ZZZ Top*). Luckily, Aesop gives you all the lyrics. Though, this can be a daunting task in itself. Sometimes I'm in the mood to dissect and speculate on what he's trying to say in any given song. Other times I just sit back and enjoy the auditory haze, basking in the always stellar production. For Skelethon, Aesop kept all the production to himself - save some instrumentation collaboration here and there.
This album does feel more personal than previous work. The album title itself is dark, and aptly titled, given the bleak subject matter. Aesop said he was inspired/haunted by all the death that has surrounded him over the past few years; the fundamental truth that everything living dies. He seems to have been in a secluded, self-prescribed hole of mourning while writing this. I hope he mustered up the courage to pull himself out.

**Favorite tracks:** *ZZZ Top*, *Cycles To Gehenna*, *Fryerstarter*, and *Grace*.

## #1 Frank Ocean - Channel Orange
![#1 Frank Ocean - Channel Orange]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2012/1-frank-ocean-channel-orange.jpg)

### Listen to "*Pyramids*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/49080453&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false"> </iframe>

I had no problem arriving at this album being my favorite of the year. Since its release in July, I've been consistently blown away with each listen. Frank has this unique ability to take seemingly mediocre lyrics and execute them with such a vulnerably personal sincerity. He writes and composes with a wisdom and maturity far beyond his years. This is one of the most well-crafted, well-executed albums I've heard in a long time. Calling it a masterpiece is a good start, but doesn't quite give it adequate praise.
This album represents everything I deeply love about music. It has everything. Now if only it would be released on vinyl - *seriously, WTF?*.

**Favorite tracks:** *Thinking Bout You*, *Lost*, *Pink Matter*, *Forrest Gump*, and my favorite song of the year *Pyramids*.

* * *

### Looking forward: 2013

#### D'Angelo
In 2013 I'm hoping we see a new D'angelo record. It's been 12 years since the masterpiece *Voodoo* was released. The brilliance of that release isn't lost a bit on me today.

#### Cecil Otter
Cecil is probably my 2nd favorite emcee in the Doomtree crew. I need a follow-up to 2006's/2008's Rebel Yellow.

#### Earl Sweatshirt
I need a debut full-length from this guy. I've listened to *<a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/48822-watch-the-video-for-earl-sweatshirts-chum/" title="Earl Sweatshirt - Chum Video">Chum</a>* a ridiculous amount of time in the last month. Give me an album, please.
