## Kauan - Sorni nai

This is a builder. It's slow, deliberate, diverse, and tells an [epic story](http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/68880/Kauan-Sorni-Nai/).

**I'm digging these tracks:** _Akva_, _Kit_, and _Khurum_.

## Drudkh - A Furrow Cut Short

I've been a big fan of Drudkh for years; loving some albums, feeling neutral about others. This one is pretty great so far. It's _on par_ with their last few records, and that's not a bad place to be.

**I'm digging these tracks:** _Cursed Sons 1_, _Cursed Sons 2_, and _Embers_.

## Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats â€“ The Night Creeper

Drug-infused? Drug-produced? Maybe. Creepy and psychedelic? Yes, delicious. Let's get creepy.

**I'm digging these tracks:** _Downtown_, _Melody Lane_, and _The Night Creeper_.
