Ex-Cop play their own special blend of black metal-meets-noise, mostly black metal though. They are crazy, create damn fine music and have unparalleled taste in beer. A relatively new band, Ex-Cop is made-up of members from <a href="http://www.myspace.com/cellphonenoise" title="Cellphone Music" class="external">Cellphone (rip)</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/1waterbear2" title="Waterbear Music" class="external">Waterbear</a>. Though they have not had an official release, they do frequently perform at unknown underground venues near you. It's probably someone's basement, hotter than hell, sweat-dripping and flying everywhere. Hell, there is probably a naked guy straddling an air conditioner, flopping his dong about and throwing food coloring at the audience. There is beer, music, deep film discussion and extreme levels of intoxicated pedal-falling-off bike-riding. But that's the way Ex-Cop rolls. Peace to Mikkeller.

## About the design
If you hadn't guessed it yet, this is heavily inspired by the work of the legendary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass" title="Saul Bass" class="external">Saul Bass</a> and more specifically his work for the 1959 classic film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy_of_a_Murder" title="Anatomy of a Murder" class="external">Anatomy of a Murder</a>. I've always adored hand-crafting type and I dig it when it's sloppy. I had no master plan with this and wanted it to appear D.I.Y. Sure, this poster design could be refined, but I wanted to preserve it, as-is. A testament to experimenting with typography. Over time, I plan to hone my hand-craft-type skills and expand, in my own way, on the work of a legend. Note the "ex-cop" outlined body/figure assembled out of .38 special bullets - matching the .38 special revolver. All Ex-Cop, all day long.

When I think of the members of Ex-Cop, I think of the 1950's-1960's. I am ridiculous nostalgic and obsessed with the 50's & 60's. A time when I didn't exist, but love to think of what it must have been like. Shout-out to Mad Men.

This is not a typical black metal aesthetic but who says it needs to be.
