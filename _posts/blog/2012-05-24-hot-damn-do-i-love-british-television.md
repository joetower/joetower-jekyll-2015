I've been a fairly long-time fan of British programming. My love affair started with the classic series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fawlty_Towers" title="Fawlty Towers Wikipedia Entry">Fawlty Towers</a>. I still hate that John Cleese and Connie Booth couldn't sort out their marital issues for the benefit of the show. I would have gladly accepted another handful of episodes. Alas, we're left with quality over quantity at a mere 12 episode run.

The mindset of quality over quantity is a rare commodity in the entertainment industry, and very appreciated in the British television approach. Series' don't tend to wear out their welcome and spiral out of control (*cough* The U.S.'s Office *cough*). The British Office will, in my opinion, always reign superior to the U.S. version. If for no other reason than the Brits knew when to quit. Over here we're all about squeezing the life out of art for the sake of profit (if a show is even given a chance to gain traction). I'd say the only networks that have a clue are premium channels like HBO and Showtime. They are all about quality.

Without further rant nonsense, here are some of my favorite British shows. Most of these are currently available for streaming on Netflix.

### <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchwood" title="Torchwood">Torchwood</a>

**Status:** *Still making episodes*

Take a little X-Files, and more than a dash of Doctor Who and you have Torchwood. The series starts off rather rocky. The first two series have more than a few borderline bad episodes. <a href="http://www.toplessrobot.com/2012/05/the_5_best_and_5_worst_torchwood_episodes.php" title="Topless Robot Examines Torchwood">This article</a> highlights the best and worst episode of the series to date.

To date, the third series is the critically acclaimed and glorious winner. The atmosphere, suspense and pacing, combined with the atypical-to-the-series miniseries format of 5 episodes help to hone-in on quality writing. Think of M. Night Shyamalan's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_%28film%29" title="Signs">Signs</a> with a way better story and far more horrifying aliens.

I have not watched the fourth series yet (Netflix get on it!) but have not heard good things. That makes me a bit sad.

### <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peep_Show_%28TV_series%29" title="Peep Show">Peep Show</a>

**Status:** *Still making episodes*

Think "The Odd Couple" gone vulgar, with way more awkward and excruciatingly uncomfortable moments than The Office. Peep Show centers around the lives of Mark (uptight) and Jez (Jeremy - the slob). Each show presents some kind of ridiculous scenario, and typically revolves around their mutual failures with women. Come see Mark get raped, Jez doubt his worth, and Superhands get off and on the crack.

### <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd" title="The IT Crowd">The IT Crowd</a>

**Status:** *Series ended (2006-2010) - final "special" pending*

The show that sounds nerdy but really isn't all that nerdy. The IT Crowd is another well crafted office place sitcom, but with the stylism and wit only the British can execute. The cast is perfect, and like any well written show it relies on the acting ability of its cast. Matt Berry is especially incredible, but he is glorious in everything he touches.

### <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_Behaving_Badly" title="Men Behaving Badly">Men Behaving Badly</a>

**Status:** *Series ended (1992-1998)*

This show centers around 2 roommates, their women, and their jobs. The appeal of this show it in how it feels. There are several humorous moments, crude moments, and some uncomfortable ones. To me this is a great Sunday afternoon kind of show.

### <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Books" title="Black Books">Black Books</a>

**Status:** *Series ended (2000-2004)*

I've only watched the first few episodes so far, but I'm liking the workplace hostility/quirkiness theme. Dylan Moran plays the bitter and sloppy shop owner of "Black Books". He is possibly more ruthless with customers than Basil Fawlty. As a viewer, you really have to put aside any rational thought in asking yourself how his shop stays in business. The traditional "open" and "closed" sign is replaced with only "closed". Black Books is never open for you to patronize it. Go away.

### <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxondale" title="Saxondale">Saxondale</a>

**Status:** Status: *Series ended (2006-2007)*

Steve Coogan is a burnout pest exterminator who wishes he was still a roadie. Lucky for us, we get to see what happens *after* the higher points of his life.

### <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_%28TV_series%29" title="Sherlock">Sherlock</a>

**Status:** *Still making episodes*

As I'm writing this post I just completed the first series and loved every minute. Take parts of the inferior show recipes found in Monk, Lie to Me, and other dime-a-dozen detective shows. Then add a far more interesting cast, better writing, and you almost have a show resembling Sherlock.

**Status:** *Series ended (1978-1990)*

My buddy Nicholas used to watch this show as a pre-work morning-routine coffee drinker. I sat in on a few episodes and was intrigued. This feels like a somewhat soothing show to watch - even though it can be very sad. It's still in my Netflix queue and I'll have to revisit it.
