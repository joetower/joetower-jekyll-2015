## Son Little - S/T

I've been waiting for Son Little's full-length for over a year; since first hearing the incredible _Your Love Will Blow Me Away When My Heart Aches_. After countless listens to that song a a handfull of others he's released since, we now have a full-length. It's fantastic!

**I'm digging these tracks:** _I'm Gone_, _Your Love Will Blow Me Away When My Heart Aches_, _Lay Down_ and _Go Blue Blood Red_.

## Odesza - In Return (Deluxe)

What a fun beat record this is. Rather, the deluxe version includes instrumental versions of all tracks (plus additional bonus tracks). I enjoy both versions, but definitely appreciate the stellar beats for jamming to while working.

**I'm digging these tracks:** _Always This Late_, _Say My Name (feat. Zyra)_, _All We Need (feat. Shy Girls)_, and _It's Only (feat. Zyra)_.

## Deerhunter - Fading Frontier

For some reason I never bothered to checkout Deerhunter and their 6 previus, critically-acclaimed albums. What a dumb mistake. If you're in the same boat I was, I advise you to jump overboard immediately. Really great record.
