I was torn this year. I went back-and-forth on whether or not I'd make a year-end best-of. Between the 10 hours or more I put into the construction of the post - from establishing album order and sizing album art, while re-listening to each record, then re-listening to each again while I compose brief write-ups and now this year, custom-designed posts...sheesh, clock 15-20 hours. Not to mention, if I'm still comfortable ranking each release with my own seemingly arbitrary and wholly-subjective sense of worth. I'm no musician, I simply adore the world's musicians. In the end I thought "who am I kidding, of course I'll make a list". So here it is.

![#15 Yeasayer - Odd Blood]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/15.Yeasayer-Odd_Blood.jpg)

## #15 Yeasayer - Odd Blood

**Yeasayer** have managed to craft one of the most incredible pop albums I've heard. From start to finish, the highly infectious rhythms, lyrics that are subject to daily outbursts of glorious pop-sex, and the production's overall sex appeal are too outrageous to pass up. I've listened to this record more than almost anything else this year. I know this will be on many year-end "best of" lists. I'm sure my co-workers might be sick of Yeasayer popping up in weekly Tenaris* sessions.

Yeasayer's 2007 debut, **All Hour Cymbals** was something unique, possibly less accessible, definitely less pop-oriented, less polished and overall felt more funk-based with east Indian vibes scattered throughout. I'm quite curious to hear their next adventure.

*Tenaris is an appropriately misspelled Tanaris, which is a city from World of Warcraft. Neither have anything directly to do with music. Every Friday afternoon, my co-workers and I put a handful of favorite songs into an iTunes playlist, I shuffle them up a fair amount and hit play. My old work PC was called Tanaris, I misspelled it and mispronounced it. So it is now referred to and labeled as Tenaris.*

**Stand-out tracks include:** *ONE, Ambling Alp, Madder Red* and *Mondegreen.*

![#14 Woe - Quietly, Undramatically]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/14.Woe-Quietly_Undramatical.jpg)

## #14 Woe - Quietly, Undramatically

**Woe** is a black metal act, currently home-fronting out of Philadelphia, PA. Their approach to black metal is fairly straight-forward. **Quietly, Undramatically** is their second full-length release and their first as a full band. You will definitely notice the production style on the title track (above) - at times it feels a bit off, unsettling. What you have are those in-your-face aggressive moments (which I love) mixed with the more minimal, melody-driven, less isolationist hypnotic guitar rhythms, and rather stellar clean vocal passages. What I love about black metal is that it demands something from its audience. Simple passive listening is seldom appropriate for consumption or enjoyment. It requires the listener to pay attention. The closer one pays attention, often times, the more they find. 

Some folks favor Woe as just Chris Grigg and adore the debut **A Spell for the Death of Man**. I'm on the fence and can't (or don't care to) compare them. I thoroughly enjoy both incarnations of Woe. I hope they continue creating memorable black metal. 

**Stand-out tracks include:** *The Road From Recovery, Quietly, Undramatically*, and *Full Circle. *

![#13 Exodus- Exhibit B: The Human Condition]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/13.Exodus_Exhibit_B.jpg)

## #13 Exodus- Exhibit B: The Human Condition

Man, I never thought I'd have **Exodus** on a yearly best of, as I've never been a huge fan. Luckily, that changed this year. My friend/roommate Nicholas has been completely obsessed with renewing his love for thrash over the course of the year. Exodus have been a highlight - often heard echoing throughout the house. Whether we're racing (video games) and need that thrash-edge or simply having a conversation, Exodus fit the bill nicely. I was most surprised to find Exodus still making pretty awesome albums. In this new age of Metallica and Megadeth it's always refreshing to find an old school metal act still worth your time. Similar to Testament, Exodus are as brutal as ever and can release one hell of a kick-ass album.

The lyrics are often brutal, horrific, awesome and definitely not workplace-play-out-loud appropriate (depending on where you work). The opener *"Ballad of Leonard and Charles"* starts the album off right and doesn't hint at slowing down. I recommend this album to anyone who can't stand what bands like Megadeth and Metallica have become.

**Stand-out tracks include:** *The Ballad of Leonard and Charles, Hammer and Life, Class Dismissed (A Hate Primer)*, and *Good Riddance.*

![#12 Sade - Soldier Of Love]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/12.Sade-Soldier_of_Love.jpg)

## #12 Sade - Soldier Of Love

**Sade** definitely has that whole "adult contemporary" stigma associated with her music. Sometimes those genre associations scare me because I probably won't like it, but Sade is a rare artist. She is incredibly passionate about what she does, as every detail is perfect and often equally dramatic. She *is* the sorrow we all feel, wrapped-up in an easily digestible package. Her latest effort is fairly remarkable. I've had a hard time (and still do) with some of the production being too polished and less-than-intimate. Her voice is tender, intimate, wrapped-up and delivered in an emotionally-piercing package. Pain, sorrow, heartache, relationships. Her lyrics transcend life.

The title track here is brilliant. The music video is brilliant. From the crushing bass line and drums to the well-crafted lyrics, this is my clear album highlight and the song I've listened to the most.

Thanks and welcome back Sade.

**Stand-out tracks include:** *Soldier of Love, Babyfather, Long Hard Road*, and *The Safest Place. *

![#11 Janelle Monáe - The Archandroid]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/11.Janelle_Monae-The_Archandroid.jpg)

## #11 Janelle Monáe - The Archandroid

**Janelle Monáe** has some impressive lung cannons (not her breasts, vocals, vocals). Her debut record is, in a word, stunning. She has the unique ability to be pop-friendly while being less-than-accessible by casual listener standards. The Archandroid is an ambitious genre-spanning collection of impressive, ass-shaking, memorable, and well-structured songs. 

I was fairly slow in acclimating to this record over the course of the year. I'd listen to it, enjoy it, but wouldn't be left feeling one way or another. Over the last few months those initial sentiments changed. Her ability to mix-up her vocal approach, often using an echo-back, vocal stutter, or whathaveyou, always tailoring her approach to each song is very impressive. Take for example, *Oh, Maker*, which begins with a beatlesesque vocal delivery at the start of each verse and slowly morphs into her dynamic vocal hook. Her approach to crafting songs is dynamic, interesting, and beautiful. The album is not absent of misses. Take "Sir Greendown" or "Locked Inside" for example, which definitely feel somewhat out-of-place. Overall, this record exhibits originality, some breathtaking moments, and delightful surprises.

**Stand-out tracks include:** *Dance or Die, Cold War, Tightrope, Oh, Maker*, and *57821.*

![#10 Arcade Fire - The Suburbs]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/10.Arcade_Fire-Suburbs.jpg)

## #10 Arcade Fire - The Suburbs

**Arcade Fire** are no stranger to critical praise. Their previous 2 records are worthy of acclaim and the same can be said for The Suburbs. From the title track to its closing continuation the record feels whole. It's beautifully, painfully nostalgic. I think of the 70's while listening to this album. I wasn't alive in the 70's and if you know me, you know I have an affinity for things from the past - times when I wasn't alive. Those were seemingly more simple times and I often long for the Dick Van Dyke way of life (1960's but you get the idea - Mary Tyler-Moore for a wife, yowza!). The Suburbs is a glorious recollection of childhood, whether you were alive during my projected time period or not. Even at its darkest, most post-apocalyptic moments, it fulfills this theme. I will flat-out say that I listened to this record more than most on this list. I'd go as far to say it's my favorite Arcade Fire record and I thoroughly adore it. 

I'm not sure how they do it, if I need to even think about how they do what they do, but both thoughts are meaningless. I just put some headphones on, lay back and enjoy the hell out of this brilliant record.

**Stand-out tracks include:** *The Suburbs, Ready To Start, Rococo*, and *City With No Children.*

![#9 Burzum - Belus]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/9.Burzum-Belus.jpg)

## #9 Burzum - Belus

So **Varg** isn't the shiniest happy person living today. Some hate him and from a purely moral standpoint, I'd be inclined to agree with them. But none of that nonsense really matters. What matters is that he's making music again. His first album in 11 years is his best work since the earth-shattering-classic Filosofem. Belus has bits of that Filosofem sound. It has the staple, incredible guitar layering I adore, common to the Black Metal genre (especially the isolationist stuff). It has similar production - possibly a bit more bass in the mix, but I don't have experience in mixing so I won't elaborate. His vocal approach is not as overtly vicious. The songs he's crafted are stellar. So now I ask myself some questions. What's new here? What else has Varg pushed-forth, exceeding expectation? What 4-headed bastard child has he pushed-out his urethra now?

So the record isn't ground-breaking and may not have lived-up to the hype only an 11 year hiatus could propel. I really dig this record and I'm happy to place it alongside my Burzum collection.

**Stand-out tracks include:** *Belus Doed, Glemselens Elv, Kaimadalthas Nedstigning*, and *Morgenroede.*

![#8 Lazerbeak - Legend Recognize Legend]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/8.Lazerbeak-Legend_Recognize_Legend.jpg)

## #8 Lazerbeak - Legend Recognize Legend

A while back I did an <a href="/music/reviews/2010/09/23/lazerbeak-legend-recognize-legend-album-review/" title="Initial Lazerbeak Legend Recognize Legend Review" class="external">initial impressions</a> on Lazerbeak's first full-length record. That review will be far more in-depth than this blurb here. I've absorbed the record more over the last few months and still adore it. I'm not sure it will have the staying-power or consistent rotation of emcee-driven Doomtree records, but it's a different beast. 

Beak is absolutely brilliant at what he creates. His beats are, in my opinion, second to only Kanye West (whose latest record I love for the beats alone, and Nicki Manaj's verse on *Monster*). Lazerbeak is indie records answer to Kanye West. I seldom hear more fitting beats than Lazerbeak's consistent lavabangers. He's just *that* good. On top of being obscenely dope on the beat-front he's one of these nicest dudes you'll ever meet. If you see Doomtree live (which if you're reading this and haven't, correct this unfortunate unhappening immediately) don't hesitate to flash the beak gayng sign and give the dude a hug.

If I had one complaint about this record, I'd venture to say it's too short. I want more Beak.

**Stand-out tracks include:** *Land's End, Bound, Pearly Gates*, and *Tempest.*

![#7 B. Dolan - Fallen House Sunken City]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/7.B.Dolan-Fallen_House_Sunken_City.jpg)

## #7 B. Dolan - Fallen House Sunken City

The world wasn't ready for this record. I wasn't ready for it either. This is one intensely dense beast of a record. B. Dolan has redefined the hip-hop record in 2010. From his wordy, expertly-crafted lung rockets to the awe-inspiring Alias production, this thing is flat-out ridiculous. Dolan's lyrics take several listens to full digest and even then you probably have plenty of questions. I love challenging hip-hop. Lyrics that offer layers, to be dissected, examined and re-examined. B. Dolan fits the bill as well as Saul Williams did on Amethyst Rockstar. His delivery is spot-on. On first listen you may find each track seemingly melt into one another. I find this might be a symptom of his delivery combined with the demand resonating from the crushing beats. At times both are seemingly attacking one another for your attention. As a result, the record is heavy, really heavy. I can seldom take the full album in one-shot, but adore it in small doses. I'm just happy he has so much to say. *The Hunter* is my favorite track - from the lyrics, to the beat, to the delivery, perfection.

**Stand-out tracks include:** *Leaving New York, Fifty Ways To Bleed Your Customer, The Reptilian Agenda, The Hunter*, and *Marvin.*

![#6 Dessa - A Badly Broken Code]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/6.Dessa-A_Badly_Broken_Code.jpg)

## #6 Dessa - A Badly Broken Code

I've been waiting for a full-length from **Dessa** for 5 years. I'm thrilled to say that I'm mostly satisfied. Her lyrics are delicate and cerebral, yet very approachable. It helps that the delivery and package are gorgeous. From the album opener "Children's Work" I knew this album was worth the wait. Over the last 5 years Dessa has grown as an emcee, improving her flow and has further developed her beautiful singing voice (full-length Boy Sopranos please, a live album, something). Most notably, her voice shines on the haunting "Poor Atlas", "Dixon's Girl", and the emotive plea "Go Home".

The only thing that bothers me about this record is track 13. I find "Crew" to be sentimental, nostalgic and cute from a lyrical standpoint but find the chorus childish and painfully corny. The supporting "happy" beat behind the hook could exacerbate the problem. You know, maybe it is solely the beat. Maybe the beat is wrong. Bah, whatever. To me the song doesn't fit-in with the rest of the record. At first I thought the last 3 tracks could be omitted and it would make a better record. I do, however, like "Alibi" and think "Into The Spin" could be more appropriate as a bonus track. With this paragraph behind us, let's just say this record is great.

**Stand-out tracks include:** *Poor Atlas, Dixon's Girl, Mineshaft II, The Chaconne*, and *Go Home.*

![#5 Deathspell Omega - Paracletus]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/5.Deathspell_Omega-Paracletus.jpg)

## #5 Deathspell Omega - Paracletus

Those crazy French bastards. **Deathspell Omega** completes a trilogy on a high note. Paracletus might be my favorite of the three - at least I find it to be the most easily digestible. As I look-back on **Kénôse**, I recall adoring it. While listening to it recently, I thought to myself, "Why did I like this so much? I still like it but not as much as I once did. I don't know quite what to make of **Fas – Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum**. It's disjointed, jarring, vastly different and possibly the most ambitious album they've crafted. It's most definitely further-removed from the Black Metal genre label. 

To me, Paracletus is a far more accessible record all-around. The songs are tightly-constructed, memorable and more immediate. You don't find the meandering or as-disjointed song structures as Fas. You're left with a seemingly more thought-out, better executed record. I'm all for dramatically challenging music, but at the end of the day I'll find myself taking pleasure in the more accessible challenging record.

**Stand-out tracks include:** *Wings of Predation, Epiklesis II, Devouring Famine, *, and *Apokatastasis Pantôn.*

![#4 Twilight - Monument To Time End]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/4.Twilight-Monument_To_Time_End.jpg)

## #4 Twilight - Monument To Time End

The supergroup **Twilight** are back with their second full-length release. I love this album and it's definitely my favorite black metal record of the year. It's dense, hypnotic, epic and melodic. Those are key ingredients to a stellar black metal album in my book. The album opener *The Cryptic Ascension* starts out as a hypnotic guitar riff building-up and resting, rebuilding and resting, climaxing and resting, distorting silence. In the center, clean-vocal haunting chants echo behind brutal vocals. Ending similar to it begins. Hey post-rock, what's up?

You know what? I always feel silly spelling-out black metal albums, so I'm going to stop now. If you love black metal and haven't heard this yet, please do. This record is most definitely post-rock meets black metal eargasmness. It's different and I adore it. Lastly, note the incredible and abrupt tempo-shifts in *8,000 Years*.

**Stand-out tracks include:** *The Cryptic Ascension, Fall Behind Eternity, 8,000 Years, *, and *The Catastrophe Exhibition.*

![#3 Gayngs - Relayted]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/3.Gayngs-Relayted.jpg)

## #3 Gayngs - Relayted

**Gayngs** are a supergroup of sorts. More like a super-collaboration. It's a journey beginning with the prowl for sex, followed by actual sex, orgasm/climax and post-coital "hey lover, stay the night". To say this record is all kinds of awesome would be an understatement.

So, wait, what's up?
We got Zach Coulter on the prowl, Ivan Howard lovingly caressing your thigh, Phil Cook crying about everything, Stefon Leron making amends for friends, Jake Luck doesn't have a butt what-what, Mike Noyce feels awkward alone in the corner watching, Zach Coulter returns for more foreplay slip-n-slide style, Justin Vernon brings the sex-grease, Maggie Wander's got the backup on sexy lock-down, Zach Coulter returns for one last ride and Ivan Howard doesn't leave you feeling lonely, naked on the bathroom floor covered in vomit after your senior prom.

**Stand-out tracks include:** *The Gaudy Side of Town, The Walker, No Sweat, Crystal Rope*, and *Faded High.*

* * *

![#2 Joanna Newsom - Have One On Me]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/2.Joanna_Newsom-Have_One_On_Me.jpg)

## #2 Joanna Newsom - Have One On Me

**Joanna Newsom** is adorable and delicate. A 3-disc record from any artist is quite the daunting undertaking - as a listener or as a creator. As always, Joanna crafts superbly gorgeous songs. I find **Have One On Me** to be her absolute best piece of work to date. In this 3-disc format that could easily fit on 2, she makes singing seem easy, sometimes redefining beauty. Her voice is one of the most unique and overtly astounding noises I've had the pleasure of hearing. The vocal range control she wields is insane. She has also managed to push-back and hold-in her previous rampant vocal squeak. I appreciate this more than anything else. With the squeak-removal service firmly in order, we are left with 18 songs of pure harptastic bliss. There are so many perfect moments on this record that I won't go in to detail. If you have ears that like music, well friend, this album might be for you. Oh hey, did I mention that Joanna found Joni Mitchell's vocal-approach and used it a bit? Oh yeah, it's still awesome. 

**Stand-out tracks include:** *Easy, Have One On Me, Esme, '81, Go Long, No Provenance*, and *Baby Birch.*

![#1 Bilal - Airtight&#39;s Revenge]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2010/1.Bilal-Airtights_revenge.jpg)

## #1 Bilal - Airtight&#39;s Revenge

So we have number one. This year may have been harder than any previous to arrive at number one. **Bilal Oliver** hasn't released an album in 9 years. Well, he had that little masterpiece called **Love For Sale** that will never see the light of day, but I digress. So 9 years is a long time to wait for another masterpiece. I've already written in length about <a href="http://joetower.com/2009/02/the-importance-of-bilal-oliver/" title="The Importance of Bilal Oliver" class"external">His awesomeness</a>, so I'll conserve space. I'm thoroughly happy <a href="http://www.plugresearch.com/" title="Plug Research Records" class="external">Plug Research</a> picked Bilal up and I hope they treat him well.

***Airtight's Revenge*** could be ahead of its time. Folks may never recognize or appreciate its brilliance or the genius of Bilal. Hopefully, if you're reading this and are of the uninitiated, you may be prompted to get in the game. Perhaps we'll land to the same conclusion. We have mounds of dense production, velvety vocals, sexy lyrics and stunning vocal athletics sprawled-out for the world to hear. I have great admiration for this old soul. Lyrically, Bilal sticks close to relationships, pondering life's encounters, tragedies, and waxes the metaphysical.

In short, Bilal brings back soul music in a big way, pushing the boundaries and carrying the genre with him Thank you Bilal.

**Stand-out tracks include:** *Cake & Eat It Too, Restart, Levels, Robots*, and *Think it Over.*
