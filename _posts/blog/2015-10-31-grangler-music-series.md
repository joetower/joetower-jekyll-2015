## Origin, passion, reasoning
For the last 8 years I've been poring over my favorite albums, artists, songs of the year and compiling a pair of CDRs to gift to family and friends for the holiday season. This was a bit of a _passing of the torch_ so-to-speak, in that my uncle Steve used to compile CDRs as his annual gift. Steve passed away 8 years ago, so I've been assembling my own compliations; both as a tribute to him and because I really _really_ love music. And even more than loving music, I love sharing music and maybe introducing others to their new favorite artist. If I recall, correctly, Steve's compilations were more Adult Contemporary in scope. If I were to describe my interpretation it would be kind of all over the place: eclectic.

In addition to fulfilling the music nerd in me, this process also fulfills me, as a designer. I get to design for my favorite thing: music. For the most part each cover's design is rather simple. For the past few years I've removed color; as I've chosen to use a back-and-white toner-based printer instead of a color ink jet. I can be fairly pragmatic, at times, I suppose. Also clearly at the forefront has been typography decisions. Clear and bold seems to have dominated several years. As you can see, themes/templating tended to stick around for more than one year.

## 2008 : Volumes 1 &amp; 2

## 2010 : Volumes 5 &amp; 6

Year three contained all 2010-specific music, despite retaining the "new and old" disclaimer adorning the artwork. This collection of songs is predominantly r&b/soul based. The year saw great releases from local hip-hop collective extraordinaire, **Doomtree**; with songs/albums from **Dessa**, **P.O.S**, **Paper Tiger**, **Lazerbeak**, and the Doomtree-contributing supergroup **Gayngs**, which is made up of all kinds of Minneapolis awesomeness. Sprinkled throughout the Doomtree madness is a mix of pop, classical, rock, and hip-hop tracks.

![Volume 8]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/grangler-music/grangler-music-cover-8.png)

## 2011 : Volumes 7 &amp; 8

**Active Child** ushers us into this series. Like an all-too-familiar voice/style bringing you back to the early 90s. Everything about Active Child, from his voice to production style reminds me of the early 90s/ late 80s for some reason.

Who knew **Frank Ocean** would go on to release what could be his only masterpiece in 2012's _Channel Orange_. I say that half-serious, as [the internet has been going nuts](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/11-artists-who-need-to-drop-a-new-album-like-now_563bcc8be4b0411d3070467f) about his sophomore album's announced release date of July 2015 coming and going with no further word from Frank. At any rate, man this was a great year for music.

Before the **Weeknd** went pop and slayed the mainstream with pairs of earworm-inducing songs: _I Can't Feel My Face_ and _The Hills_, he wore his troubles more prominently for all to see. **Abel Tesfaye** finally figured out how to mix his misogynistic psycho sexual brand of r&b with the right amount of socially acceptable, eccentricity? Great! Now mix in a winning pop formula, his always-great vocals and you have the next pop sensation. All an early 20-something needs to self destruct, eh? Glad the world is giving him all kinds of ammo. I'm conflicted: I want to like him, but he's so unlikeable it's laughable to even consider liking him. One can not deny his talent. I am forever stuck in a sadistic paradox. One thing is certain, Tesfaye's more rough corners; his darkest lyrics, and creepiest production have been reduced to almost unrecognizable versions of themselves. Like something pretty, only hinting at being dark and creepy - instead of being overtly dark and upfront about his intentions. I'm not sure which is worse.

These volumes decidedly closed with two of my favorite **James Blake** songs of the year. First with a swirrling jarrer of hypnotism _I Never Learnt To Share_. Then, volume 8 closes with the unreal **Joni Mitchell** cover _A Case of You_. His version [still destroys me]({{ site.url }}/2012/06/typography-in-music-joni-mitchell/ "James Blake and Joni Mitchell - Typography in Music").

## 2012 : Volumes 9 &amp; 10

**Graveyard's** third album didn't strike me like their 2nd, but it's still enjoyable. Their brand of sludgy psychedelic blues rock is still unmistakably Graveyard.

**Katatonia** released another incredible album, in **Dead End Kings**.

I've been a fan of **Macklemore** since 2009's _Unplanned Mixtape EP_. But I really started paying close attention when he and Ryan Lewis put out 2010's _The VS_ and _The VS Redux_. _Vipassana_ was my jam. It's been several years, but I swear he put out a _The VS_ EP and some months later repackaged it with remixed in _The VS Redux_ but I can't find a real instance of _The VS_ by itself (need to keep googling).

So now, in 2012, they come along and release an album that would catapult them beyond their own ambitions. Of course, the record didn't truly hit its stride until 2013 - because not everyone keeps a close watch on underground-to-mainstream artist transitions.

**P.O.S** released his most polarizing record - an odd mix of I don't know how to describe, tracks, in _We Don't Even Live Here_. From some solid, truly great songs (the couple I included here) to vulgar craziness - _Fuck Your Stuff_, this album still leaves me scratching my head a bit. It's now 2015 and I should probably re-visit this record.

## 2013 : Volumes 11 &amp; 12

**Earl Sweatshirt** emerged from seclusion to unprecedented internet pressure and hype. His debut full-length is exactly what it was meant to be; a brilliant young artist throwing something out there and seeing how it's received. While not all of the record hit me like _Chum_ did, it's still a great record. Though, I have to empathize a bit and try to put myself in his world view to appreciate the record. Even then, I fall short - being a white guy who largely grew up in the suburbs and experienced very little economic/societal struggle. I can only empathize so much. What I do know is that Earl will only get better. I look forward to hearing what he's talking about years from now.

**Chvrches** debut record was refreshing, great even. Very in-ine with 2013's fresh take on older genres - the cycle of influence, if you will. Its inclusion here was a no-brainer - both in terms of quality and sequencing. Unfortunately, I can't say the same will be true for songs on 2015's release _Every Open Eye_. Too much of the same for me. They have such a niche sound. One whose longevity was uncertain from the beginning. I'm reminded, not in style, but by a shared niche sound longevity sentiment in **Alt-J**'s material. Both, to me, are almost unlistenable now. I'm not sure why that is. Maybe I didn't really ever like them that much in the first place. Ha, ramble ramble.

On a similar note, **London Grammer** and **Haim** saw much commercial and critical success. 2014 was an interesting year for debut female-fronted records. I'm a big fan of all of that.

Local hometown hero (and as of 2015, MN homeowner and resident once again!) **Har Mar Superstar** saw his most commercial success. It also saw his most serious, well-formed, consistently thematic work in **Bye Bye 17**. Gone are the silly, playful party lyrics, what remains is the hear and soul of Har Mar's world.

**James Blake** returned and absolutely crushed his debut record - albeit in very different genre distinction confines. His confidence in singing ability, overall musicianship, songwriting are all radically on-point and thoroughly engaging. I'm still holding out for _Radio Silence_ his third full-length record to be release in 2015. We'll see. James Blake and Frank Ocean: please release new albums this year. Pull a D'Angelo for 2015.

## 2014 : Volumes 13 &amp; 14

**D'Angelo** released his incredible third album, randomly, in December of 2014. His songs just snuck into their places. This, as I always strive to achieve, is a very eclectic mix of genres.

**Thom Yorke** partnered with **Bit Torrent** to try out a new music delivery mechanism - well, new to the legal side of music downloading, that is. I'm not sure if Bit Torrent was successful in delivering more albums to music-hungry fans, but I know Thom's album downloaded quickly and the process went smoothly. What is unfortunate is that the album itself didn't land how anyone really anticipated. There was barely mention of Thom's album on internet year-end-best-lists. That's too bad, but I too agree, it wasn't up to par with _The Eraser_.

### On sequencing:

I'm big on opening and closing with strong, memorable, songs. I'd like every track to be memorable, but I like framing the sequence with solid book ends. At times I feel a more jarring genre juxtaposition in song-to-song transition pairings is in order, and at other times find a more seamless glide appropriate. Point being, sequencing matters, and I try to approach every year differently.

## 2015 : Volumes 15 &amp; 16

This year I made it a goal to have fewer repeat artists than previous years. Just my luck, the year produced some truly incredible records.

**Nils Frahm** released a wonderful, free, **Solo** piano album. Volume 15 opens with one of my favorite piano pieces _ode_ and Volume 16 closes with another favorite _Some_. Both pieces feel like great bookends to the series this year. If you would like to have the whole album, [download it here](http://www.nilsfrahm.com/works/sol/ "Download Nils Frahm's Solo album").

**Son Little** released his debut solo album this year. I really can't say enough great things about this guy and his band. They are crazy talented and exude soul. Maggie and I had the privilege of seeing them perform at 7th Street this year. We were not disappointed. I wrote about Son Little [earlier this year](http://joetower.com/2015/10/recent-records-05/ "Son Little Recent Records 5").

**Courtney Barnett** is sure to be at the top of many "best of" lists. It's easy to see why; as this record is superb.

**Kamasi Washington**'s _The Epic_ is also a sure-to-top "best of" lists. This is one of the most subgenre-spanning jazz records I've ever heard. It's also one of the best modern jazz records I've heard, period. I wrote about Kamasi [earlier this year](http://joetower.com/2015/05/recent-records/ "Kamasi Washington Recent Records 2").

**Sufjan Stevens** writes beautiful music. This record might be his most crushingly depressing records to date. It's also his best album to date.

**Chelsea Wolfe** also released her best album to date, in the excellent _The Abyss_ release. Her sound is so much fuller sounding than previous records. I wrote about Chelsea [earlier this year](http://joetower.com/2015/09/recent-records-04/ "Chelsea Wolfe Recent Records 4").

I had to include **Drake**'s thoroughly ridiculous but amazingly catchy campy smash hit that everyone parodied or covered. I can't even call this a guilty pleasure. It's just a wonderful awful great song.

**Floating Points** came out of nowhere to put out one of the years most interesting electronic albums - brilliantly fusing jazz/glitch/ambient sounds.

**Miguel** put out one of my more immediate favorite fun records of the year. I feel like he's finally shedding his more pop-filled previous records and challenging himself, creatively.

**Dollarstore Keyboard** is a childhood friend's (Colin Swenson) latest music project. Colin is an exceptional musician and I always look forward to hearing what he comes up with. This is definitely the most remarkable body of work he's produced to date.
