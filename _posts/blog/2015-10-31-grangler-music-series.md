## Origin, passion, reasoning
For the last 8 years I've been poring over my favorite albums, artists, songs of the year and compiling a pair of CDRs to gift to family and friends for the holiday season. This was a bit of a _passing of the torch_ so-to-speak, in that my uncle Steve used to compile CDRs as his annual gift. Steve passed away 8 years ago, so I've been assembling my own compliations; both as a tribute to him and because I really _really_ love music. And even more than loving music, I love sharing music and maybe introducing others to their new favorite artist. Steve's compilations, hmm, how to put it, were more Adult Contemporary than my interpretation. Truly, mine tend to be all over the place: eclectic.

This process also fulfills me, as a designer. I get to design for my favorite thing: music. For the most part each cover remains rather simple. For the past few years I've removed color; as I've chosen to use a back-and-white toner-based printer instead of a color ink jet. I can be fairly pragmatic, at times, I suppose. Also clearly at the forefront has been typography decisions. Clear and bold seems to have dominated several years. As you can see, themes/templating tended to stick around for more than one year.

## 2008 : Volumes 1 &amp; 2
The first year very little of the music contained on the playlists were released that year. Instead I opted to ease-into _my_ vision for these annual playlists and learn as I went along. The songs here were mostly timeless classics that anyone _should_ appreciate in one way or another.
