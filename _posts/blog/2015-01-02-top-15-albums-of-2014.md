## #15 Grouper - Ruins
![#15 Grouper - Ruins]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/grouper-ruins.jpg)

### Listen to "*Call Across Rooms*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/166857997&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

I was surprised to learn that _Ruins_ is **Grouper's** 10th studio release.

>Where have I been?

I'm a sucker for slow, brooding, atmospheric textural journeys. Solid piano work, creepy vibes, and low-key female vocals, all of which are wins in my book. **Liz Harris** reminds me of a more refined, more minimal **Korouva**. Or, rather, perhaps the other way around. **Korouva** reminds me of a less refined **Grouper**. Whatever, they share similar musical space.

This is a record for cold days, Minnesota days, winter days, rainy days, or just days where you need a bit of music therapy.

Buy [Grouper - Ruins](http://www.amazon.com/Ruins-Grouper/dp/B00MQJX9E2)

**Favorite tracks:** *Clearing*, *Labyrinth*, *Holding*, and *Made of Air*.

## #14 Tommy Guerrero - No Man’s Land
![#14 Tommy Guerrero - No Man’s Land]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/tommy-guerrero-no-mans-land.jpg)

### Listen to "*Loco's Lament*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/141661548&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

> I found myself in the desert. No water. Gunslingers hanging around every corner. What is this... place?

A notion of adventure. Hints of something more to come. What are those shadows lurking in alleyways? Tommy Guerrero has crafted an album perfectly suited to score a film. I'm thinking a more polished _Dead Man_-like **Neil Young** score, here. In the meantime, put on some headphones and do whatever it is you do at your desk.

Buy [Tommy Guerrero - No Man’s Land](https://tommyguerrerotoogood.bandcamp.com/album/no-mans-land)

**Favorite tracks:** *The Gunslinger*, *The Stranger*, and *Loco's Lament*.

## #13 FKA Twigs - LP1
![#13 FKA Twigs - LP1]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/fkatwigs-lp1.jpg)

### Listen to "*Two Weeks* (remix)" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/162927210&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>


I adore **Tahliah Barnett's** stunning voice. One can't help but be in awe of her voice. This is a pretty great debut record. The one shortcoming, for me, is her highly sexual lyrical content. Don't get me wrong, it is a _hot_ record. For some reason, after sinking in a bit, the lyrics feel cheap in some way. Maybe Tahliah is a super sexual being and this is the type of hyper sexual music she _needs_. At any rate, I dig it, but I look forward to future releases for more depth(?).

> Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover /
Flying like a streamer thinking of new ways to do each other /
Pull out of the incisor give me two weeks, you won’t recognize her /
Mouth open you're high.

Buy [FKA Twigs - LP1](http://www.amazon.com/LP1-Explicit-FKA-twigs/dp/B00MY4YE52/ref=sr_1_1?s=dmusic&ie=UTF8&qid=1419450508&sr=1-1&keywords=fka+twigs)

**Favorite tracks:** *Two Weeks*, *Pendulum*, and *Hours*.

## #12 Arca - Xen
![#12 Arca - Xen]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/arca-xen.jpg)

### Listen to "*Thievery*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/167213046&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

For whatever reason this year, I found myself more enamored with, for lack of more specific genre description, _electronic_ music. We can split hairs and say _idm_, _edm_, _glitch_, etc, but really, whatever. **Arca's** debut record is dark, off-putting, and all kinds of awesome. Texturally, I find this record fascinating.

**Alejandro Ghersi** has worked with **Kanye West** on the brilliant _Yeezus_ record. **FKA Twigs** also used his production prowess for her debut release _LP1_. He is currently [working with Bjork](http://pitchfork.com/news/56910-arca-shares-thievery-video-is-producing-bjorks-new-album/) on her new release - coming in 2015.

_Xen_ is an interesting listen. From glitched-out scattered moments (*Family Violence*), to the more rhythmic and melodic (*Sad Bitch*), this is headphone music at its finest. The layering enables new discoveries with every listen. That's pretty awesome.

Buy [Arca - Xen](http://www.amazon.com/Xen-Arca/dp/B00NHQ3P9C/ref=tmm_msc_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=)

**Favorite tracks:** *Now You Know*, *Sad Bitch*, *Family Violence*, and *Thievery*.

## #11 Aphex Twin - Syro
![#11 Aphex Twin - Syro]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/aphex-twin-syro.jpg)

### Listen to "*minipops 67*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/166180397&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

*Richard D James* is a beast of a man. It's true that I'm more a fan of his [Selected Ambient Works](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Ambient_Works_Volume_II) type material, over the more upbeat and glitchy. Unfortunately for me, the latter firmly wins the stacking contest that makes up his catalog of music. With that said, _Syro_ is a pretty great record. I had a hard time positioning it in this list. Ultimately it wound up at number fifteen, because, well, I haven't listened to it as much as the other records on this list. Sure, I was immediately floored by album closer *aisatsana*. It's a beautiful piano piece. The rest of the record took a long time to sink in.

>This record is about details, and those details need to be observed up close.

Buy [Aphex Twin - Syro](http://www.amazon.com/Syro-Aphex-Twin/dp/B00N4Y33VM/ref=tmm_msc_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=)

**Favorite tracks:** *Xmas_Evet10*, *Produk 29*, *syro u473t8+e*, and *aisatsana*.

## #10 Thantifaxath - Sacred White Noise
![#10 Thantifaxath - Sacred White Noise]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/thantifaxath-sacred-white-noise.jpg)

### Listen to *"5 songs"* from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/30574570&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

*Thantifaxath* are a mystery. The mythos goes something like, three anonymous members exist and tour the country as _"Thantifaxath"_, while remaining anonymous.

Their music, well, geez. To call it an onslaught of pummeling beats, unnerving discordance, and brain fracturing black metal, might be an understatement. This record is my favorite, more abrasive, metal record of the year. But even in all its abrasiveness stands epic beauty.

To whomever claims the name Thantifaxath, thank you. This is a hell of a debut record.

Buy [Thantifaxath - Sacred White Noise](https://darkdescentrecords.bandcamp.com/album/sacred-white-noise)

**Favorite tracks:** *The Bright White Nothing at the End of the Tunnel*, *Where I End and the Hemlock Begins*, and *Panic Becomes Despair*.

## #9 Matthew Halsall & The Gondwana Orchestra - When the World Was One
![#9 Matthew Halsall & The Gondwana Orchestra - When the World Was One]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/matthew-halsall-when-the-world-was-one.jpg)

### Listen to *Snippets of songs* from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/156189671&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

Would you believe me if I told you that people still made jazz records like they did in the 1950's or earlier? I know, I know, you're saying

>Yeah, right, Joe, whatever. You're insane.

Well, friends, I'm happy to report that this is one of (of many others, I'm sure - but presently unaware of) those very albums. Listening to the album opener, and title track _Matthew Halsall & The Gondwana Orchestra_ sends me to the land of **Coltrane** and **Davis** and older hard bop jazz releases. I'm not necessarily talking in terms of composition, but in _aged sound_. Those familiar jazz textures are found in this record.

There are also eastern influences found here - which make this record more diverse. We're talking the Japanese Koto and Bansuri flute. I very much enjoy _Kiyomizu-Dera_, and _A Far Away Place_ - both highlight these instruments effectively.

Buy [Matthew Halsall & The Gondwana Orchestra - When the World Was One](https://matthewhalsall.bandcamp.com/album/when-the-world-was-one)

**Favorite tracks:** *When the World Was One*, *Falling Water*, *A Far Away Place*, and *Kiyomizu-Dera*.

## #8 Sylvan Esso - S/T
![#8 Sylvan Esso - S/T]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/sylvan-esso-st.jpg)

###Listen to "*Coffee*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/120738399&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

This album makes me smile. It's fun, light, but rich with flavor. That sounds like chocolate, or umm coffee. Whatever. This album has such polish, such layering, that it feels wise beyond the youth of the group/duo.

Sylvan Esso are qualified as an _electro pop_ duo, hailing from Durham, North Carolina. To me, what is most unique here are the details. Take, for example, in the single *Coffee*, at about 3 minutes in, Amelia busts out with a soulful rendition of the hook from [Tommy James and the Shondells' "Hanky Panky"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83bo9W7OORQ). That just brings a smile to my face.

Nuanced flavoring aside, this is a solid record, and a damn fine cup of coffee.

Buy [Sylvan Esso - S/T](http://www.amazon.com/Sylvan-Esso/dp/B00IIJ9PQK/ref=sr_1_1?s=dmusic&ie=UTF8&qid=1423888590&sr=1-1&keywords=sylvan+esso)

**Favorite tracks:** *Could I Be*, *Coffee*, and *Play It Right*.

## #7 Woods of Desolation - As the Stars
![#7 Woods of Desolation - As the Stars]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/woods-of-desolation-as-the-stars.jpg)

### Listen to "*Unfold*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/132837641&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

This is the type of layered awesomely epic, anthemic, black metal release I look for. I've said it several times:

> I'm a sucker for densely layered guitars and black metal vocal cries.

The goods have been struck here, aplenty. There are also more flat-out rock sections to be found; often nestled within the dense layers of echoey guitar passages. Records like these are best enjoyed with a great set of headphones, a dark room, and just you and the music existing in the same space for however long the record is, or however many times you care to have it repeat.

Buy [Woods of Desolation - As the Stars](https://woodsofdesolation.bandcamp.com/album/as-the-stars)

**Favorite tracks:** *Like Falling Leaves*, *Unfold*, and *Withering Field*.

## #6 PHOX - S/T
![#6 PHOX - S/T]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/phox-st.jpg)

### Listen to "*Kingfisher*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/159149642&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

_Slow Motion_ came to me via [The Current](http://www.thecurrent.org/). After which, I immediately listened to the whole record.

This really has been a year for standout debut records. *PHOX* are a six-piece act, qualified as _alternative folk/indie pop_. *Monica Martin's* voice is unique, in that she has a memorable and fascinating voice. A voice reminiscent of other standout female vocalists, such as *Leslie Feist* and *Cat Power*, but still uniquely different on its own.

Interesting tidbit according to the Wikipedias: [This record was recorded in Justin Vernon's home studio in Eau Claire, Wisconsin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHOX).

Buy [PHOX - s/t](http://www.amazon.com/PHOX/dp/B00JC8DTB8/ref=sr_1_1?s=dmusic&ie=UTF8&qid=1419450597&sr=1-1&keywords=phox)

**Favorite tracks:** *Slow Motion*, *Kingfisher*, and *Noble Heart*.

## #5 Deadwood - Picturing a Sense of Loss
![#5 Deadwood - Picturing a Sense of Loss]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/deadwood-picturing-a-sense-of-loss.jpg)

### Listen to "*White Tears Gently Touching The Earth*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/127723422&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

Favorite metal release of the year right here. Beautiful, hypnotic, isolationist black metal, and then some. There are some surprising moments of zen to be found here. I've fallen asleep to this record several times throughout the year. That's a compliment, in my world.

Buy [Deadwood - Picturing a Sense of Loss](https://deadwoodvoid.bandcamp.com/album/picturing-a-sense-of-loss-2)

**Favorite tracks:** *Burden Of Rememberance*, *White Tears Gently Touching The Earth*, and *Ending Circles*.

## #4 Pharoahe Monch - PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
![#4 Pharoahe Monch - PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/pharoahe-monch-ptsd.jpg)

### Listen to "*Rapid Eye Movement*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/143736917&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

I've been a big fan of Pharoahe since he commanded us to "Get The Fuck Up / Simon Says Get The Fuck Up" in an abusive game of Simon Says. Those were the golden days of Rawkus Records, and 1999's awesome _Infernal Affairs_. Many years later I went through Pharoahe's back catalog, specifically his records with *Prince Poetry* called *Organized Konfusion*.

Pharoahe went quiet for a while, after Rawkus fizzled out. In 2007, we got an awesome comeback record in *Desire*. Monch got more political with 2011's *W.A.R. We Are Renegades* release - though his lyrics have always revolved around government and war. Which brings us to his latest record, which is an extension of sorts to *W.A.R.*, and equally (if not moreso) angry record, with this year's *PTSD* release.

Pharoahe is never short of excellent wordplay, and always finds stellar production to set his words upon. *PTSD* is, lyrically, exactly what you'd expect, given the title. Pharoahe has said this is his most personal record to date; dealing with deep depression, and his battle with asthma.

Pharoahe's metaphors can always put a smile on my face - not because they're cheery, but because they provoke thought to derive meaning.

>The best liar told a lie inside a room full of liars /
The lie was so exciting that all of the liars admired /
When the truth walked in the building every liar retired

Phaorahe's got wordplay for days.

Buy [Pharoahe Monch - PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder](https://pharoahemonch.bandcamp.com/album/ptsd)

**Favorite tracks:** *Bad MF*, *Time2*, *Damage*, and *The Jungle*.

## #3 Have A Nice Life - The Unnatural World
![#3 Have A Nice Life - The Unnatural World]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/have-a-nice-life-the-unnatural-world.jpg)

### Listen to "*Defenestration Song*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/126018672&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

The Music _Have a Nice Life_ craft is calculated, fuzzy, sometimes abrasively punkish, and other times beautifully melodic. I'm a fan of eclectic music, and those who exhibit eccentric behavior or taste.

Take, *Defenestration Song* above, for example. That bass line is straight out of a *Joy Division* track (_Walked The Line_, but by the end of the track is a sludgey awesome mess. The vocal delivery isn't much further off from *Joy Division*, either. The chorus escalates into ragey punkdom. To me, this is a pretty perfect song. The version found here is actually the second version of this track - originally appearing on their 2010 _Voids_ cassette release. The versions are very different.

This sophomore record is, in some ways, more approachable than 2008's debut _Deathconsciousness_ release. Both albums are pretty great - but I'd place _The Unnatural World_ in a more immediate/accessible bucket. _Deathconsciousness_ is a truly great record, but one that is more challenging in scope.

Buy [Have A Nice Life - The Unnatural World](https://theflenser.bandcamp.com/album/the-unnatural-world)

**Favorite tracks:** *Guggenheim Wax Museum*, *Defenestration Song*, and *Burial Society*.

## #2 Tycho - Awake
![#2 Tycho - Awake]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/tycho-awake.jpg)

### Listen to "*Plains*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/138292321&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

I wrote about this album some months back. I've listened to this more in 2014 than anything else. Tycho truly out did himself with this record. I enjoyed _2011's_ *Dive* quite a bit, but not like *Awake*.

Buy [Tycho - Awake](https://tycho.bandcamp.com/album/awake)

**Favorite tracks:** *Awake*, *Montana*, *L*, and *Dye*.

## #1 D’Angelo - Black Messiah
![#1 D'Angelo - Black Messiah]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2014/dangelo-black-messiah.jpg)

### Listen to "*Sugah Daddy*" from this record:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/181260617&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

At 12:35am, on Monday morning, I made the fortunate mistake of checking Instagram and Twitter, while trying to sleep. [I saw this](http://instagram.com/p/wmxPRtwa4Z/) and franticly checked Amazon Music to buy the album. Alas, it was there and I didn't fall asleep for a few more hours.

What I experienced on that first listen was something beautifully painful. Beautiful in that, I haven't heard this _"sound"_ since 2000's masterpiece _Voodoo_, and what's more, the last time we heard a bulk of new material in 14 years. Painful in that, I was not emotionally prepared for what I was going to hear. My only mistake was that I didn't get out of bed and grab better headphones.

Since midnight of its release, and at the time of writing this - one week since its release, I've fully digested the album. Well, I should say, I feel like I have. This record will not leave daily rotating for months.

I'd like to leave this at simply _"it was worth the wait"_, but this record is more than that. Sure, I could sit here and hurl innumerable amounts of superlatives at this record. They would all be accurate. This is, hands down, the best record I've heard all year. D'Angelo is a master, and now the world has another piece of his genius to consume.

Buy [D’Angelo - Black Messiah](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Messiah-DAngelo-Vanguard/dp/B00QXL7MC4/ref=sr_1_1?s=dmusic&ie=UTF8&qid=1419450639&sr=1-1&keywords=d%27angelo)

**Favorite tracks:** *1,000 Deaths*, *Really Love*, *Betray My Heart*, and *Another Life*. But honestly, **there isn't a bad song on this beast**.
