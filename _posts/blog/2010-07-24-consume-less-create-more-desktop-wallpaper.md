This is a phrase that stuck in my head today. I decided, hey, I should make a quick desktop wallpaper. Callin (co-worker) is always telling me I need different wallpapers at work. He hates my wallpapers.

I'm a big fan of minimal desktop backgrounds, flat color, nice type, relaxing and not complex. These fit the bill. I figured maybe someone else out there might want a minimal background and might also like the phrase.

## Brown, Black/Gray or Orange <em>1680 x 1050</em>
