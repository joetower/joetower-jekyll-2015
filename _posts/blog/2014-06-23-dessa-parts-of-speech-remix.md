## Album versus the re-imagined re-edit

Similar to Dessa's debut (2010's Badly Broken Code) companion record released one year after its release, 2011's Castor the Twin, now 2013's **Parts of Speech** has a companion record, of sorts.

These re-edits/children aren't as radically different from their reinterpretation/parents as Castor's are; you won't find live instrument versions of any songs from Parts of Speech. Each remix is more tame, but very different from the original piece.

## Love for the remix
What I love about these remixes is that, for some odd reason, I've listened to and appreciated each interpretation almost more than the actual album versions. Perhaps I find these reinterpretations less serious and more fun than the actual album versions? For whatever reason, some of these remixes are incredible.

###Fighting Fish

_**"Zeno’s arrow / never hits the mark / It’s always / hanging there over its shadow /safe from battle / waste of arch - / er’s time and trouble / waste of effort / waste of parts / If you don’t aim for the center / it’s a waste of the art"**_

This chorus murders my ears and echos for days. I'm not sure why this presentation helped me appreciate the album version, but I'm happy it did.

###Warsaw

_**"And I'm still living by my maiden name / The name I came with / The name I made / And I'm bare-faced at your masquerade"**_

This is one of my favorite tracks from Parts of Speech.

**Cecil's Version**
I really adored the album's original beat. It was one of the few beats on the record that I loved the first time I heard it.

Cecil's version is pretty unreal.

**Budo's Version**
I love what Budo did with this remix. It is **so** great.

###Call Off Your Ghost

This Committee (Lazerbeak x Ryan Olson) remix is a lot easier to listen to than the album version. This chorus killed me, in a bad way, on the album. Here I find it pretty great.

###It's Only Me
There are two remixes of this found here. I prefer the **Year of the Horse** version over the **Grant Cutler** mix.

###Skeleton Key

This is, by far, my least favorite Dessa song. The hook is catchy, sure, but it's also repeated an uneccesarliy high amount of times throughout the song. I'd count each time it's mentioned, but it's like nails on a chalkboard to me. I can't do that to myself. I hate this chorus. The remix does the song a great service by not echoing the chorus ad nauseam. So, yay?

## Dessa the poet
Dessa is a brilliant writer, and even better at singing and rapping her own words. Her lyrics are second to few artists. Now I'll have to go back and revist Parts of Speech with a fresh perspective.
