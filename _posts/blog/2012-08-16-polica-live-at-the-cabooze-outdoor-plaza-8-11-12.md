## Jarrod Miller-Dean
Jarrod (Jargy) is one of my best friends ever. He's like the brother I never had. After leaving Minnesota about 10 years ago, he's back. What better way to celebrate than by going to a show.

Jargy and I have a shared love affair with music. From hunting down hard-to-find Swedish metal, to blasting the Grateful Dead while eating sandwiches in his ridiculous Geo Tracker, we loved music. I would say our tastes are similar. He got way more into Skinny Puppy and the whole hippy scene than I ever did, but we seek-out similar qualities in music. Over the past 10 years we haven't really talked about new music. That changes now.

## The Cabooze Outdoor Plaza
Jarrod and I walked to the Cabooze for an evening of music, beer, and food.

### Zoo Animal
These folks were good, but ultimately nothing special. I feel like they would translate far better on record than in a live setting. That's crazy to say, but I would probably give a studio recording some solid listening.

### Supreme Cuts
This dubstep duo hails from Chicago. They put on a good show. MPC and sample-driven drum pads. They surprised me a bit.

## Polica Prequel: A brief back story - Game Night 2006
I've been a fan of Channy Leaneagh since I heard Roma Di Luna's first album, **Find Your Way Home**. The sparse beauty of *Plenty* really wowed me. Back in 2005-2006 I had the pleasure of attending a local game night every Sunday evening at my friend Rachel's apartment. Channy and her then-husband Alexei Moon Casselle were in attendance most nights.

If you told me back then that Channy had an incredible voice, I'm not sure I would've believed you. I don't recall ever hearing her speaking voice. She struck me as mysterious, and maybe a bit shy. I never struck up conversation mostly because I was always a bit nervous being around the revolving cast of local hip-hop artists (you know, the "I'm not worthy" bullshit immaturity). I was (and still am) a huge Doomtree fan, and local music fan in general. P.O.S, Sims, Paper Tiger, MK Larada, Cecil Otter, and Turbo Nemesis were all frequent attendees. In retrospect, I wasn't a complete disaster around any of them, but I wasn't exactly myself either. It's all so silly, really.

Channy's half of Roma Di Luna always impressed me. She had a gorgeous voice, and a very delicate stage presence. Who knew she'd be wowing me with her dance moves a year after Roma Di Luna's breakup.

When I first heard Polica's album I was a bit off-put by all the vocal processing. After watching an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzCmCcwQpk0" title="Channy's SXSW Interview">interview with Channy</a>, I warmed up to the vocal treatment. I will go as far to say I now love it. I feel it genuinely *adds* to Polica's music. Her voice is an instrument. One filled with heavy, sometimes depressing, emotion. It's a struggle between mourning and bliss.

### Polica
Channy and company's performance was exactly as anticipated. Channy beautifully and passionately danced about the stage, swaying with every note. It's incredible to watch. Sure, you could say I find it attractive, but it's more than that. I believe in her conviction. Like any artist worth a damn, I buy into every word she sings. She is wonderful at being physically emotive. One could say hauntingly so. Her notes and body perform in unison. If you haven't seen Polica yet, go see them. If you find yourself disappointed, you might want to rethink your interest in music.

Jarrod had never heard them before, but seemed to dig Polica. He wasn't as enthralled by Channy's hypnotizing performance as I was. I totally buy into emotions, hard. Well, again, as long as they are perceived as genuine. Emotion is almost the sole reason I love music.

## Cold Beer, No Women: Conclusion
We ended the night with beer and food at Tracey's Saloon. Jarrod had Rogue Dead Guy Ale. I had a "Serious" which is Surly Furious mixed with Summit ESB.
On our walk back to my house we strolled through Milwaukee avenue's sub-neighborhood of woodsy goodness. Jargy seemed to dig the neighborhood vibe. Seward is a fantastic place to live.

Welcome back Jarrod.
