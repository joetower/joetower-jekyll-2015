We've been having a long email thread at work recently about [Christopher Nolan's comments regarding _content_](http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/9/5883669/christopher-nolan-says-theaters-can-survive-in-netflix-world) and more specifically, the medium by which content is packaged / conveyed to its audience.

>Older than film is live action stories, or plays. Well, duh, but you know... connecting dots and keeping this post rolling.

## The Guthrie Theater
My girlfriend and I received a $75 gift certificate to the [Guthrie](www.guthrietheater.org) last Christmas. Instead of spending the full amount on one _regular run_ ticket, we opted to purchase _preview_ show tickets; getting to see three shows instead of one. After seeing all three _preview_ shows, I'm not sure I would pay to see a _regular run_ show. Perhaps I'll notice more nuanced and refined performance in the future -- after I'm a more seasoned theater goer. But man, from what I've seen, it's tough to fault preview shows at all. All three were exceptional.

### 1. Crimes of the Heart

This story prompted many laugh-out-loud moments. I'm a big fan of single-environment stories - for example, **Hitchcock's** excellent [Rope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(film)). This story holds your interest without more elaborate set work.

### 2. My Fair Lady

I'm a fan of the 1938 film adaptation of [Shaw's classic Pygmalion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_(play)), but the actual play is far superior. Admittedly, I have not seen the 1964 [film adaptation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Fair_Lady_(film)) -- hoping to remedy this negligence soon. From what I've heard, the 1964 film is a fairly line-by-line adaptation.

We were at the opening night of preview shows and the cast seemed absolutely spot-on perfect. The set was far more elaborate than either other play we saw. There was a drop-down piece in the center of the stage (a couch would sink and rise atop the dropped platform), and two revolving interior / exterior set pieces.

I'm a fan of some of the songs in this musical adaptation of Shaw's story. My biggest issue with this version of Shaw's classic is that the end drags quite a bit. Well, Pygmalion and My Fair Lady both suffer from the same end / resolve problem. I hate that Eliza ends up with Higgins. Critics and theater goers preferred this ending, and we now see it one way - at least, to my knowledge.

### 3. Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike

This was, hands down, our favorite and most enjoyable theater experience to date. Out of all three, this story kept us thoroughly entertained and laughing hysterically throughout the 2 hour run time.

I'm not familiar with **Chekhov**'s work, but that did not detract from my enjoyment of the story. I found the dark humor hilarious, and will absolutely checkout Anton Chekhov's work.

## Plays are pretty awesome
I could go on and on about how plays are a lost art form; under-appreciated by my generation and those younger than me. I'll just say that I'm happy to have grown to appreciate the theater and look forward to years of new play experiences.
