Beth Ditto and company have been releasing quality music for 10 years. I have enjoyed watching them evolve from their raw, more primal beginnings, to their infectious dance-infused rock disco of today. _**Music For Men**_ offers their most hypnotically ass-shaking, dance-club groovin, cracked-out funk music to date. It's absolutely fantastic and it never fails to wake me up on those days that just drag. I'm a sucker for quality female vocals and Beth Ditto's are among the most outstanding in modern music.

This album finds the Gossip at their most "poppy" to date, but there is nothing wrong with that. With standout tracks like "_Heavy Cross_", "_8th Wonder"_, "_Pop Goes The World_", "_Four Letter Word_" and my personal favorite, the ultimate gay anthem "_Men In Love_". The whole album is solid and a welcomed release after their incredible 2006 release _**Standing In The Way Of Control**_.

I can't really say anything else about this release, it's fantastic, go get it.
Maybe I'll write more later.
