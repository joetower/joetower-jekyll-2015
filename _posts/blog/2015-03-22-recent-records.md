## Lady Lamb the Beekeeper = After

This is another record very conducive to driving / coding / designing. I've just let it play all the way through once a day, for a week or so. I'm diggin it. I guess [Tommy Guerrero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Guerrero) is one of those crazy rare talents - [skateboarder](https://www.rvca.com/t/anp-artist/tommy-guerrero) and [musician](http://www.asphaltduchess.com.mobilom.net/artists/tommy-guerrero/). What a combo.

## Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly

**Common** hasn't released a truly awesome record in many years. After several listens, I still haven't been able to appreciate _2007's_ **Finding Forever**, _2008's_ **Universal Mind Control** (least favorite, by far) or _2011's_ **The Dreamer, The Believer**. None of them had a single song that did anything for me. This is sad considering prior to this triple threat of awful, Common had been fairly consistent. I may be in the minority in having some level of apprecition for the eccentric _2002_ release **Electric Circus**. I thought that record was a bit misdirected, but I really appreciate the huge risk and eclectic collection of music.

**Nobody's Smiling** is most impressive from a production standpoint. Every beat on here is pretty great - definitely the best since 2005's **Kayne**-centric **Be** record. Common seems to have a rejuvinated sense of how to ride each beat.

Common seems more focused, lyrically, on this record. I attribute much of this to the refreshing return of **No I.D.** on the production front. Common himself acknowledges this on **Rewind That**. This is one of my favorite tracks (if not my favorite) on the record, so far. I'm a fan of nostalgia-driven lyrics like this - and, of course, deeply personal. This offers a look back at a very long and largely impressive career. Common reflects on Dilla's final moments on earth, and his up and down relationship with No I.D. and several other collaborators, throughout his lengthy career.

**I'm digging these tracks:** _No Fear_, _Blak Majik_, _Rewind That_, and *_Young Hearts Run Free_

*Deluxe edition, only.

## José González Vestiges & Claws

I'm a sucker for a wicked falsetto, down-beat / haunting production, and ethereal vocals. It's no surprise that I have found myself listening to this British trio's record quite a bit.

Vocalist, **Ry Cuming** has a **Thom Yorke**-esque vocal delivery. Adam Freeland and Steve Nalepa have a mixed production style. The production is an odd mix of scratchy, almost drawn-out glitch, hollow drumb claps, casio keyboards and dancehall beats. I'm not sure how long my interest in this record will last, but I'm enjoying it right now. With records like this, headphones can make the record. The sparse production feels deliberate, and somewhat **James Blake**-esque. At times you'll hear **XX**-like guitar swells.

**I'm digging these tracks:** _Animal_, _Veda_, and _Ghost_
