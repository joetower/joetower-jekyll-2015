## Late to class

I'm kinda late to the flexbox party, but with good reason. I swear flexbox support still wasn't all that great. Well, I was wrong. Over the next few weeks to a month I'll be slowly converting my [singularity grids](https://github.com/Team-Sass/Singularity) over to flexbox. Why? Because it's fun and I'd like to play with it. Also, because my website should be a playground if nothing else.

There are a [bunch](http://www.sitepoint.com/are-we-ready-to-use-flexbox/) [of articles](http://www.isflexboxreadytouse.com/) [about Flexbox being ready](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/flexbox-next-generation-css-layout-arrived). And it's true, it really is ready, and damn it's great. If you need to support IE8, you can likely get by with an IE8 stylesheet and [modernizr](http://modernizr.com/download/) tests. But really, no one should care about IE8. I'd like to not care about IE9 or 10, either.

## Why is it so great?
My favorite part is being able to write far less code to create a [simple grid](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/grids/). Or being able to [vertically center things](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/vertical-centering/). How about being able to easily achieve the [holy grail of layouts](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/holy-grail/)? Or a [sticky footer](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/)?

Boom.
