At work, I offered to take staff photos for our semi-new website and for other internal tools - to use as profile pictures. I'm not a professional photographer but a few of these turned out pretty swell.

## Story time
Callin (co-worker) was having hair issues (needed a haircut) and decided to start styling his hair differently to remedy said issues. The style, well, it was reminiscent of something you might have seen in the 1920's or 30's. Perhaps, either a pomade or the popular Dapper Dan brand did the slick. His hair (and this photo) made me think of the Coen Brother's classic **O Brother Where Art Thou?** - and more specifically George Clooney's character. That character, Ulysses Everett McGill, had countless notable quotes. For the purposes of this piece (design), the memorable quotes whittled-down to either the one I used or "*How's My Hair*". The former seemed more fitting, so I ran with it. Since this photo was taken (this past Monday), Callin has cut his hair and no longer looks like a little boy. 

If nothing else it's just plain fun and another excuse to post a blog entry. I'm really enjoying the challenge of styling individual posts to match the content. This may seem like a random post, and it is, but that is how I roll.
