## Lady Lamb (the Beekeeper) - After

I've been following Lady Lamb for years. Probably since 2010's **Mammoth Swoon** release and the fantastic track _Crane Your Neck_. Her debut proper album, 2013's **Ripely Pine** was good, but it didn't grab me like I hoped it would; given her promise on Mammoth.

This record finds Lady Lamb more mature, and I feel like she's coming into her own as a crazy talented artist.

## Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly

Kendrick is unquestionably one of the best lyricists and rappers ever. His new record is crazy dense. I've listened to it a few times through, and still feel like I'm barely scratching surface-level appreciation and comprehension. This thing is a beast.

The biggest drawback for me is the constant overuse of the n-word. Given the awful racial tension in the past year (especially), the fact that I, myself, am an over-priveledged white guy, and well, it doesn't make me feel great about having these lyrics kick around in my head. Worse yet, I can't recite these lyrics out loud; which I tend to do unconsciously at times, as I love music/language/lyrics.

Let's also call attention to the fact that, being white, I am abhorrently opposed to using/hearing this word. Unfortunately, this is something I've learned to mitigate as best I can; as this word/idiom is far too prevalent in the hip-hop/rap world. It's too bad. I'd like an artist like Lamar to be vehemently opposed to using it as well. He has the power to make this choice more widespread.

## Kamasi Washington - The Epic

Talk about a monster of a jazz record. This thing is crazy.
