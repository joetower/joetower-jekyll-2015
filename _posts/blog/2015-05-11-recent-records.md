## Lady Lamb (the Beekeeper) - After

I've been following Lady Lamb for years. Probably since 2010's **Mammoth Swoon** release and the fantastic track _Crane Your Neck_. Her debut proper album, 2013's **Ripely Pine** was good, but it didn't grab me like I hoped it would; given her promise on Mammoth.

This record finds Lady Lamb more mature, and I feel like she's coming into her own as a crazy talented artist.

## Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly

Kendrick is unquestionably one of the best lyricists and rappers ever. His new record is crazy dense. I've listened to it a few times through, and still feel like I'm barely scratching surface-level appreciation and comprehension. This thing is a beast.

The biggest drawback for me is the constant overuse of the n-word. Given the awful racial tension in the past year, the fact that I, myself, am an overpriveledged white guy, and well, it doesn't make me feel great about having these lyrics kick around in my head. Worse yet, I can't recite these lyrics out loud; which I tend to do unconsciously at times. Hey, I love music.

## Kamasi Washington - The Epic

Talk about a monster of a jazz record. This thing is crazy.
