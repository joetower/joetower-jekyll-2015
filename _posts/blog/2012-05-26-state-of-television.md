This is a frustrating conversation piece. The entertainment industry continues to stick to their broken broadcast model instead of adapting to technology and to what people want.

## Nitpicking the network approach

One of the most frustrating aspects in being a TV show adopter is relying on a network's decision making ability. NBC sure sucks at making decisions. They are responsible for cancelling the now-classic **Freaks and Geeks**, and more recently the somewhat promising **Awake**. Yet, NBC wants **The Office** to keep going? Fox has been another repeat offender having canceled **Firefly**, **Arrested Development** (twice), and more recently a not-so-average cop show called **The Good Guys**. Networks make poor decisions based on an outdated approach to a well-mannered measurement tool: the rating system. This failure has everything to do with the delivery system. More on that later.

## Bad network. NO! Oh the failure.

### Unnecessary breaks in the action

How the hell can a show be expected to last if the network splits the story in half? Take **Burn Notice** on USA for example, or any USA show, which airs 9 episodes, takes a 4 month break, resumes with 7 more episodes. By the time the show comes back, I've either moved on to something else, or forgotten about it entirely. How's that for loyal viewership?

>Let's alienate our audience and make it hard for a good show to be widely adopted, and in turn, be successful. Let's just cancel it and throw some inane yawnfest in to replace it.

Makes me sick. More and more networks seem to abide by this approach in having a revolving arbitrary number of episode "season" of shows. Maybe it's always been this way, and I didn't pay enough attention. Either way, it's broken.

### Reinforcing negative behavior

So with network tv doing things like cancelling shows due to lack of viewership, or splitting a season in half to "flush the toilet", how can a show's audience trust the network? How can anyone take a chance on a new show when the network can't even decide if it believes in it?

Given the pattern of shows being canceled before a full season run, how do they expect to obtain accurate ratings? All it does is make people think "I'll just wait to see if the show lasts" or "I'll wait for it to come out on DVD because I can't stand the "seasonal breaks". Good job network, you're great at shooting yourself in your stupid face.

### Give me quality or STFU: The quality versus quantity argument

Here's a novel idea. What if the network's only focused on giving high-quality shows the spotlight? I know this is subjective as all get out, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out.

Put effort into producing a handful of really great shows and ditch the cruft. I would much rather watch less quantity of quality shows, than waste time with filler for the benefit (?) of a network's schedule. Again, AMC wins here. Their shows have fewer episodes, no breaks, and are always well-crafted. Boom goes the dynamite.

>Waa! Waa! but we want our seasons of shows!

Example: fantastic series "x" has a stellar 12 episode season, no breaks. Series "y" comes in immediately following "x" for its first season of 12 episodes. And repeat accordingly. Simple. This approach would allow for a network's "season" mentality, but not break up a storyline. In turn, keeping people's attention. Why can't they do this? Why do we need 20-some episodes in a season?


Solution: **Make shorter seasons**.

## The death of network television

Give me internet television. On demand, whatever I want to watch, when I want to watch it. That is the dream right?


Put aside the legal issues in streaming rights that plague the almost great <a href="http://www.hulu.com/" title="Hulu">Hulu</a>. I say *almost* because many shows I watch aren't available on Xbox's Hulu app due to rights issues. This very problem prompts me on an almost weekly basis (typical life assessment thought regimen) to question why I pay for a service that doesn't give me what I want. I could very easy illegally download all the shows I watch. It's not like it's hard. For me it boils down to the convenience of the service, over the hassle in managing my own media files. The point is that I don't want to download TV shows. I don't care about owning them. Just let me watch them, and re-watch them. Don't make me illegally download them just because you, the industry, can't get your shit in a pile.

### A radical, probably awful approach

Maybe all the television networks need to combine their resources for the greater good. Maybe Apple or Google need to buyout the entire network system as we know it and rebuild. I know either company would handle a subscription television service far better than anyone else. There can still be "channels", but everything else is really meaningless. I have no allegiance to specific networks. Though, undeniably there are a few that fly far higher than the rest. AMC, HBO, and Showtime are the big names in producing quality television. All I care about is the quality of the individual shows. Those networks have made a choice to promote quality over quantity.


My only reservation with such a monopolizing takeover is a logical one; one company having too much power (duh, we have laws to protect that). Google scares me. Apple scares me less. Having one dominate force isn't the answer, and definitely isn't feasible. Perhaps reinventing the network television structure under some kind of umbrella service is the better answer. I just want everything in one cloudy place. But right now every network has their own ideas about streaming media. They all want to have their own say. This causes nothing but frustration.


My thoughts aren't new. People have been thinking the same thing for years. When is this all going to change?
