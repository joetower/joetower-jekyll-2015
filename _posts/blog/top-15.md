I've only been familiar with **Oneohtrix**'s music since his last record, 2013's _R Plus Seven_ and found that record had some really great aspects, but lost me as a whole album. For whatever reason I've found myself really enjoying _Garden of Delete_ with all its odd and unexpected twists and turns.

### Listen to "*Silhouettes*" from this record:

This is a tough and challenging record to qualify or discuss. It's somewhat equal parts ambient, jazz, noise, and glitch. **Sam Shepherd** is Floating Point and _Elaenia_ is his debut album. This record is a fluid organism. It's like a living thing. Also impressive is his use of live instrumentation throughout the whole record.

> My rant about the prevalently used n-word

This is my huge issue with _To Pimp a Butterfly_ and two other really incredible hip-hop records released by African American artists this year (**Earl Sweatshirt**'s _I Don't Like Shit. I Don't Go Outside._ and **Vince Staples** _Summertime 06_) comes down to a specific choice all three artists (_and almost every other black rapper_) has made.

The last year has been more public about systemic racism and injustice toward black people and all persons of color. It sucks and no one likes it. So my issue with Kendrick's record (Earl and Vince too) is that while it seeks to offer some type of catharsis for black culture (which is very opportune), it's also hard to listen to as a white person. I just can't hear the n-word all the time. It kills me. So while I love this record (and Earl and Vince) it's hard for me to give it the true attention it deserves. But why do I feel it deserves so much attention? Especially if I'm not its target audience? Or am I?

I suppose I can look at this in a more simplified manner. This is me acknowledging that I don't know what this means for my relationship with hip-hop that uses the n-word so prevalently. As a white male, I've never struggled more with this than I do now.

> It's hard to love language as much as I do and love hip-hop because it too celebrates language only to place so much emphasis on such a terrible word.

I understand the rationale of "repurposing" or "taking back the power of" such a word by black culture. I can not even begin to empathize with such an awful societal construct fueled by hatred, ego and narcissism. I don't feel like the word needs repurposing or a change in power dynamic or use. I simply feel like its use isn't necessary in today's world - no matter who says it. I just flat out wish people would stop using it. Why, with all the bajillion words at ones disposal, so so many black hip-hoppers use such an awful word? One of the reasons I love hip=hop is because I have a deep love for language and self expression. Any use of hateful language in music simply rubs me the wrong way. I don't mind swearing, but I do mind language used to discriminate against or perpetuate any hate agenda or intolerance.

> Why can't we live in a world where people consciously just stop using words that reflect negatively on their character?
