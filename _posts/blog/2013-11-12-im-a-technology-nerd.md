I'm not sure when it happened, but I've been a nerd about technology for the majority of my adult life. Some of it goes hand-in-hand with being in the internet field, some in being a designer, and everything with being passionate about new stuff. But, to me, "nerd" isn't derogatory. It's the opposite; it's a term that aims to succinctly capture passion, intelligence, and a unique kind of cultural qualifier in one little word.

I've hesitated to write about tech-related things because <a href="http://verge.com" title="The Verge">The Verge</a> does a better job than I ever could. I also admire their design team, for the most part. But, even though I listen to (and/or watch) the <a href="http://twit.tv/" title="This Week in Tech">TWiT network</a> (especially <a href="http://twit.tv/show/all-about-android/" title="All About Android on TWiT">All About Android</a>), and consume all tech everything on YouTube and Google Plus, I still have something unique to say. I am nothing without opinions.
 
## Apple
I exclusively use Apple's still unmatched Mac Book Pros, and still love OS X. I'm adamantly opposed to using any laptop that isn't a Mac. Most of that has to do with my profession, but also because OS X's file management has always made way more sense to me than any alternative. So awesome, I love Apple-made computers. Ugh, except that new MacPro garbage can. WTF?!?

I haven't owned an iPhone since the 3G. I've planned on purchasing an iPhone since the 4S was announced. I remember watching the <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/" title="Apple Events">Apple Keynote</a> events for the 4S, the 5, and most recently the 5S/5C - and arriving at one conclusion: I will buy a new iPhone. Ultimately, I have always given-in to the better half of my rational mind. The iPhone's camera has always brought me ever-so-close to pulling the trigger, but alas, iOS set in.

### iOS
When iOS7 was announced, I said to myself...
> Finally, Apple has redesigned iOS. It's about damn time. Maybe I'll...

Nope. The too-little/too-late updates were not enough to bring me back. Sure, iOS _feels_ better than ever, but it has still not changed, really. It's kind of ugly; having some truly disgusting icons, and possibly not as intuitive as it once was. Sure, it's still the same polished turd it's always been, at its heart. I feel like Apple has lost that brilliant glimmer that once so proudly excelled at _"giving people what they didn't know they needed"_. A somewhat odd redesign isn't enough.

iOS aside, I just don't use Apple's services/applications. Therefore, I can't benefit from their proprietary goodness. iOS will, likely, forever be my go-to tablet choice. The iPad is tough to beat. But again, that same OS is unusable, for me, when it comes to phones. I realize that sounds ridiculous. I don't care. I'm serious about phones.

I really want to use an iPhone, but I just can't. Before its formal announcement, the 5C was primed to be my next shiny new gadget. But not for more than the heavily speculated (and very realistic) $350-$400 off-contract price. I'm not sure how the tech world fooled itself into thinking a $400 iPhone would ever be a reality. Alas, $649 (32GB) for the "cheap" iPhone. WTF!? No way.

## Google
For lack of better introductory sentence about Google, __Google__ _is_ insane. Where Apple succeeds in hardware &amp; software integration, Google succeeds in better execution, reliability, and consistently innovative design.  Gmail/Youtube/Drive work very well, and for the most part, _look_ the same anywhere I use them (iOS, Android and via the web). There is still some <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution" title="Unifying Holo and Kennedy">Holo versus Kennedy</a> elements that aren't as consistent as they can be, yet.

Google's biggest challenge is getting anyone but technology nerds to appreciate vanilla Android. Cue, the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5069310/the-nexus-5-isnt-pure-android-its-pure-google" title="The Verge on Pure Google">Google Experience</a>.

### Android
From Ice Cream Sandwich to KitKat, Google has not stopped making Android better. One can't help but view the Apple versus Google rivalry as a modern day replay of Microsoft versus Apple through the eighties and nineties. Let's face it, Microsoft have made too many missteps in the last 7 years. It's going to take a radical series of changes to bring Microsoft back. I watched the Surface Pro 2 keynote and laughed at how apologetic they were for the first Surface Pro's shortcomings - of which there were _so_ many. Apple is no longer the constantly-innovating underdog. They are the safe, stable, and very predictable, billion dollar powerhouse. They have gotten too comfortable. Google has never been better.

> I use, and love, Google's products.

It really is that simple. I could stop this post right here, but I won't, yet. It may be obvious but Apple and Google couldn't be more different when it comes to vision and execution. __Steve Jobs__ was a brilliant, truly revolutionary thinker, and he really knew how to execute. Apple has definitely felt the loss.

## Knowing Who You Are
With Google, _I_ am the product. To get the most out of the "Google experience", I need to fully immerse myself into Google's world. Rather, I need to let Google get to know me. Google probably knows things about me (through data, in some form) that very few people know. But because of this, <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/now/" title="Google Now">Google Now</a> provides me with very accurate, sometimes frightening, results. If I purchase something from Amazon, it (Now) will give me shipping notifications. If I frequently search (on Google) for movie showtimes, Google will try to preemptively inform me.

> Google aims to predict what I want before I give any indication that I want something.

This is where Google starts getting interesting, and yes, scary. But again, know what you're getting into and be okay with it - if you are okay with it.
