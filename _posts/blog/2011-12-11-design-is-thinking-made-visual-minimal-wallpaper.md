I wanted to create some minimal wallpapers using famous design quotes, so my desktop can stay minimal, with just a little something extra. This might end up becoming a series of wallpapers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass" title="Saul Bass Wikipedia">Saul Bass</a> has been an inspiration to me, and specifically, an inspiration to encourage me to play with letterforms in imperfect ways. I wouldn't say that I'm someone who is particularly talented in regards to hand-lettering by way of perfection. I have a style, I suppose, but perfect lines are not strengths. I roll with the organic and unusual.

Saul's style was and *is* unique, and unmistakable. I adore his now-classic film poster designs and title sequences; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy_of_a_Murder" title="Anatomy of a Murder on Wikipedia">Anatomy of a Murder</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_%28film%29" title="Vertigo on Wikipedia">Vertigo</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_with_the_Golden_Arm" title="The Man With the Golden Arm on Wikipedia">The Man With The Golden Arm</a> being absolute favorites.

His distinct hand-lettered titles, color palette choices, the organic nature of the line work, the off-set balance of geometric shapes; all create remarkably simple, but effective designs. For me, the instant vintage sex appeal is undeniable.

For these wallpapers I didn't go with 50s or 60s color schemes, but opted for the hand-drawn letterforms. It's a hint of modern juxtaposed with irregular type, and some good old noise thrown in. There is also a complete color variety that uses the wonderful <a href="http://26plus-zeichen.de/fonts/sayitfat/" title="Say it Fat Font">Say it Fat</a> typeface, with some added vintage distress.

I have attached zipped packages of 1280x800 and 1650x1080 monitor resolutions, for anyone interested in using these on their computers. The color varieties are displayed, and individually downloadable, off to the right. To download simply "right-click" on the image and choose *save link as*.
