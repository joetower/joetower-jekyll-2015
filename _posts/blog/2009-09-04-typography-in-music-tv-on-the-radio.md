## Ambulance
TV on the Radio have a very distinctive sound. From **Tunde Adebimpe's** unique voice to **David Sitek's** production style, TvotR offer dense and subdued musical gems. Their first official release, 2004's _**Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes**_ was not only an incredible debut but offered some profound lyrical content. However cryptic and open-to-interpretation they may be, one can't help but be struck by Tunde's emotion-filled delivery. The lyrics I chose to highlight here are my favorite from this release and carry great sentiment. Of course, I'm referring to the outstanding "_Ambulance_", from the voice looped backbone to the passionate delivery, this song floors me. I remember playing it often on the jukebox at **The Bad Waitress** on Nicollet Ave. - taking in the atmosphere, especially on one, truly perfect, snowy winter evening. I do miss those days.

Another TVotR track that holds deep sentimental value to me is the **Raymond Scott** (Night and Day) sampled track "_Say You Do_", which contains the incredible vocal-sample of **Nina Simone's** rendition of "_Wild as the Wind_". That was by far the best track on the elusive _**OK Calculator**_ 2002 "backpack" release.

Since 2004 TVotR have continued releasing incredible albums and I always look forward to hearing what they do next. Great band, incredible songs.

Also, just to point-out, not even the genius of David Sitek could save **Scarlett Johansson's** butchering of **Tom Waits** songs (_Anywhere I Lay My Head_). I don't have the words for how bad that was, the production was excellent though! You can expect some Waits appearances in these typography experiments, that's for damn sure.

Anyway, hopefully those of you reading dig these weekly installments so far.
