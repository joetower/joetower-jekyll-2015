## #15 Baroness - Purple
![#15 Baroness - Purple]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/15-baronness-purple.jpg)

### Listen to "*Chlorine &amp; Wine*" from this record:
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhS0j3WxfWY)

I've liked Baroness' previous _color_ albums, but not as immediately as the newest effort, **Purple**. As countless other reviews have mentioned: the energy and love for life in this record is so epic, so hard to contain, that is oozes from the edges of every song. This record is simply a flat-out joy to listen to. The hooks make me feel positive and powerful. Great record full of positivity.

Buy [Baroness - Purple](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014ELDZM0?ie=UTF8&qid=1451591171&ref_=sr_1_1_twi_mus_1&s=music&sr=1-1)

**Favorite tracks:** *Chlorine &amp; Wine*, *Shock Me*, *Kerosene*, and *Desperation Burns*.

## #14 Leon Bridges - Coming Home
![#14 Leon Bridges - Coming Home]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/14-leon-bridges-coming-home.jpg)

### Listen to "*Coming Home*" from this record:
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrKkqE9p1o)

2015 was another year of incredible modern soul debuts. **Leon Bridges** can sing his lungs off. Call him a modern day Sam Cooke, an old soul or whatever, but know that he's only getting started. I'm excited to see where he goes from here. I definitely love this record, though at times, feel it suffers from being over-produced. I want more of what made his standout hits _Coming Home_ and _The River_ so classic feeling. Some of these tracks also feel a bit bogged-down by less-than-great lyrics. Take for example the super problematic lyrics in _Better Man_ and how he's acknowledging and propelling the idea of cheating on your significant other. I take issue with this, just as a human. Take that and mix it with just enough theology, and there is definitely room for improvement from a lyrics standpoint.

Buy [Leon Bridges - Coming Home](http://www.amazon.com/Coming-Home-Leon-Bridges/dp/B00VVZUPIU)

**Favorite tracks:** *Coming Home*, *The River*, and *Lisa Sawyer*.

## #13 Vince Staples - Summertime 06
![#13 Vince Staples - Summertime 06]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/13-vince-staples-summertime-06.jpg)

### Listen to "*Lift Me Up*" from this record:
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn15IvVrprw)

More so than Earl Sweatshirt's sophomore record this year _I Don't Like Shit. I Don't Go Outside_ I found myself really appreciating this dude's wordplay and flow. This is a seriously impressive debut full-length record.

> Highway to hell and I'm speedin', one way to tell if I'm breathin'
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof

Buy [Vince Staples - Summertime 06](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XZZLSA8?qid=&ref_=tmm_acd_swatch_0&sr=)

**Favorite tracks:** *Lift Me Up*, *Birds & Bees*, and *Jump Off the Roof*.

## #12 Tribulation - The Children of the Night
![#12 Tribulation - The Children of the Night]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/12-tribulation-children-of-the-night.jpg)

### Listen to "*Strange Gateways Beckon*" from this record:
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNZgqxAxaj4)

**Tribulation** are some seriously odd ducks. Their genre-spanning ability is remarkable. I don't think I've heard a band blend thrash and black metal so well.

Buy [Tribulation - The Children of the Night](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V5NZP6U?ie=UTF8&ref_=ntt_mus_dp_dpt_1)

**Favorite tracks:** *Strange Gateways Beckon*, *Melancholia*, *In The Dreams of the Dead*, and *Strains of Horror*.

## #11 Roseau - Salt
![#11 Roseau - Salt]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/11-roseau-salt.jpg)

### Listen to "*Salt*" from this record:
[Bandcamp](https://roseau.bandcamp.com/track/salt)

As always, every week I add interesting looking albums to my [Today's Music](https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXylx2uHMwhERRxGOk3ZrvsIPTjSApsMwm5JeGpY0_AMfP91RbLdL3oRNKC0uvF349s4TKvicvs_bCASyimNaKNJTi2XNbw==) playlist in Google Music. This approach, coupled with a relentless thirst for new music, is what led me to this wonderful record. Solid through and through.

Buy [Roseau - Salt](https://roseau.bandcamp.com/)

**Favorite tracks:** *Salt*, *Kids and Drunks*, *See You Soon*, and *Florida*.

## #10 Björk - Vulnicura
![#10 Björk - Vulnicura]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/10-bjork-vulnicura.jpg)

### Listen to *"Lionsong"* from this record:
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWHpoJT3qK4)

This is Björk's most heartbreaking record to date. Containing mostly lyrics and feelings stemming from and consumed by her divorce, the lyrics explore loss and all things heartbreak. This is also one of the first record's since, 2001's **Vespertine**, which was, to me, her best record. This record takes the intimacy and introspection of Vespertine and melds it with the more accessible bits of her last two records sounds. It doesn't hurt that Antony Hegarty appears, once again, here. I love them as a duo so hard.

Buy [Björk - Vulnicura](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SI9614O?ie=UTF8&keywords=Bj%C3%B6rk&qid=1451590920&ref_=sr_1_1&s=dmusic&sr=1-1-mp3-albums-bar-strip-0)

**Favorite tracks:** *Lionsong*, *History of Touches*, and *Atom Dance*.

## #9 Courtney Barnett - Sometimes I Sit and Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit
![#9 Courtney Barnett - Sometimes I Sit and Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/09-courney-barnett-sometimes-i-sit.jpg)

### Listen to "*Pedestrian at Best*" from this record:
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-nr1nNC3ds)

Call her the female counterpart to **Bob Dylan**, Courtney's ability to put human observations into song is rivaled by few others. This record is full of remarkable lyrics and solid down tempo but positive rhythms. What I admire most about the record is how it _feels_ like its a record rooted in simpler times. It's comfortable nostalgia.

Buy [Courtney Barnett - Sometimes I Sit and Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit](https://courtneybarnett.bandcamp.com/album/sometimes-i-sit-and-think-and-sometimes-i-just-sit)

**Favorite tracks:** *Pedestrian at Best*, *Depreseton*, and *Nobody Really Cares If You Don't Go to the Party*.

## #8 Deerhunter - Fading Frontier
![#8 Deerhunter - Fading Frontier]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/08-deerhunter-fading-frontier.jpg)

###Listen to "*Living My Life*" from this record:
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x8_3kHM18s)

This is the first Deerhunter record that I feel good about putting on a "best of" list. It's a flat-out solid, well thought out record. Similar to my thoughts on how Courtney's album _feels_, this record to has a very distinct feel rooted in some weird nostalgia for me. Maybe it's some kind of 80s _feel_ in Talking Heads-like keyboard passages. Whatever it is I like it, a lot.

Buy [Deerhunter - Fading Forever](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014CJ27OG?ie=UTF8&keywords=Deerhunter&qid=1451589863&ref_=sr_1_1&s=dmusic&sr=1-1-mp3-albums-bar-strip-0)

**Favorite tracks:** *Living My Life*, *Leather and Wood*, and *Snakeskin*.

## #7 Bell Witch - Four Phantoms
![#7 Bell Witch - Four Phantoms]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/07-bell-witch-four-phantoms.jpg)

### Listen to "*Suffocation, A Burial: I - Awoken (Breathing Teeth)*" from this record:
[Bandcamp](https://bellwitch.bandcamp.com/track/suffocation-a-burial-i-awoken-breathing-teeth)

This sophomore record is crushingly awesome. It's the best doom record I listened to in 2015. To me, Bell Witch edged-out **Monolord**'s _Vænir_ record; which was good, but not great.

Buy [Bell Witch - Four Phantoms](https://bellwitch.bandcamp.com/album/four-phantoms)

**Favorite tracks:** *All Four Tracks*.

## #6 Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly
![#6 Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/06-kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-a-butterfly.jpg)

### Listen to "*Alright*" from this record:
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY)

This is a truly remarkable record and one that deserves all its accolades, critical acclaim, Grammy awards, and number one spots on 2015 best-of lists everywhere. In every respect it's a phenomenal record. But, I've had my own struggles figuring out how to appreciate this record given its prevalent use of the n-word. Maybe it's due to age, or our currently heated societal racial tension, but I find myself questioning why hip-hop _needs_ to use the n-word so much. I *love* this record and my perceived message of what it seeks to convey. **I** am not the audience. At least, I don't think I am.

> To put it simply: why, with all the bajillion words at ones disposal, so so many black hip-hoppers use such an awful word?

One of the reasons I love hip-hop is because I have a deep love for language and self expression. Any use of hateful language in music simply rubs me the wrong way. I don't mind swearing, but I do mind language used to discriminate against or perpetuate any hate agenda or intolerance.

> Why can't we live in a world where people consciously just stop using words that reflect negatively on their character?

Buy [Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly](http://www.amazon.com/To-Pimp-Butterfly-Kendrick-Lamar/dp/B00UDDM7K0)

**Favorite tracks:** *These Walls*, *The Blacker The Berry*, and *I*.

## #5 Kamasi Washington - The Epic
![#5 Kamasi Washington - The Epic]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/05-kamasi-washington-the-epic.jpg)

### Listen to "*Change of the Guard* and more" from this record:
[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kamasiwashington/sets/the-epic)

This might be the best jazz record released in years. It's also an incredibly dense and challenging listen - requiring a lot of time to consume and enjoy. I like complexity in music; as it accommodates new learning, exploration, and appreciation with each listen. We're well into 2016 and I'm still digesting this beast.

Buy [Kamasi Washington - The Epic ](https://kamasiwashington.bandcamp.com/album/the-epic)

**Favorite tracks:** *Burden Of Rememberance*, *White Tears Gently Touching The Earth*, and *Ending Circles*.

* * *

## #4 Joanna Newsom - Divers
![#4 Joanna Newsom - Divers]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/04-joanna-newsom-divers.jpg)

### Listen to "*Divers*" from this record:
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48xlgXqQKLA)

I had the pleasure of seeing Joanna perform live at the Fitzgerald in St. Paul. She put on, probably one of my top 10, favorite shows ever. Her voice, musical ability, and stage presence were all impeccable. I could do nothing but stare in awe several times throughout the show - many times on the verge of tears.

Buy [Joanna Newsom - Divers](http://www.amazon.com/Divers-Joanna-Newsom/dp/B013SCCK5O)

**Favorite tracks:** *Sapokanikan*, *Leaving The City*, *Leaving The City*, and *You Will Not Take My Heart Alive*.

* * *

## #3 Deafheaven - New Bermuda
![#3 Deafheaven - New Bermuda]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/03-deafheaven-new-bermuda.jpg)

### Listen to "*Brought to the Water*" from this record:
[Bandcamp](https://deafheavens.bandcamp.com/track/brought-to-the-water)

I'm a huge fan of Deafheaven. Call me hipster or all up on Pitchfork's fanhoodism, but they are flat-out awesome. No other black metal act constructs such epic, emotive, beautifully diverse music. I'm reminded a bit of *Wolves in the Throne Room*'s incredible first two records. Not in every respect, of course, but in their shared ability to expand, contract, deviate from, and circle-back to the same groove.

Buy [Deafheaven - New Bermuda](https://deafheavens.bandcamp.com/album/new-bermuda)

**Favorite tracks:** *Everything: All five tracks*.

* * *

## #2 Chelsea Wolfe - Abyss
![#2 Chelsea Wolfe - Abyss]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/02-chelsea-wolfe-abyss.jpg)

### Listen to "*Iron Moon*" from this record:
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvbJY2CjrUI)

This woman has grown in talent and artistic vision exponentially. I was really torn between in my decision to rank this at number two versus number one on this list. _Abyss_ is Chelsea's most fully realized record to date. There is no filler here, just crushingly incredible music.

Buy [Chelsea Wolfe - Abyss](https://chelseawolfe.bandcamp.com/album/abyss)

**Favorite tracks:** *Carrion Flowers*, *Iron Moon*, *After The Fall*, and *Crazy Love*.

* * *

## #1 Son Little - S/T
![#1 Son Little - S/T]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/best-of-2015/01-son-little-s-t.jpg)

### Listen to "*Go Blue Blood Red*" from this record:
[Bandcamp](https://sonlittle.bandcamp.com/track/go-blue-blood-red)

I can't say express enough superlatives about Son Little's debut full-length. Aaron Livingston has finally created a record/project that is solid front-to-back. I've listened to every song countless times and only recently, three months into 2016, taken it out of my daily playlist rotation. It was hard to remove the album. That's how much I've both listened to and loved it.

I had the pleasure of seeing Son Little perform a non-sold-out show at the 7th Street Entry. The experience being back at 7th street brought me back to the late 90s Atmosphere / Rhymesayers / Anticon shows I attended there and a 1st Avenue. I have so many fond memories attending shows in small intimate venues like 7th street and 1st Avenue (when it's not sold out and awful). Sadly, I don't get the chance to see some of the artists I love most in such a setting anymore, so it's great when it does happen. In Son Little's case, I'd like to think his commercial or at least a sub-level of mainstream appeal is on the verge of exploding. All he needs is a song from this record played on TV or in a movie to propel him to mainstream status.

Buy [Son Little's Self Titled album](https://sonlittle.bandcamp.com/)

**Favorite tracks:** *I'm Gone*, *Your Love Will Blow Me Away When My Heart Aches*, *Lay Down*, and *Go Blue Blood Red*.
