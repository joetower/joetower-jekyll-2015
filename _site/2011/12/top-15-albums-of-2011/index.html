<h2 id="active-child---you-are-all-i-see">#15 Active Child - You Are All I See</h2>

<p><strong>Pat Grossi</strong> has crazy potential. Take his hauntingly beautiful falsetto delivery on <em>Hanging On</em> and <em>Playing House</em>, for example. They blew me away, and effectively landed themselves as instant “songs of the year”. The rest of the album is very much listenable, but it is not what I’d call solid. At times his voice is too airy, too insignificant to affect the songs in anything more than a voice-as-instrument manner. For some artists this works (e.g. <strong>Radiohead</strong>, <strong>Sigur Rós</strong>), for others it simply isn’t compelling enough.</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>Hanging On, Playing House, Shield &amp; Sword</em> and <em>You Are All I See</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-roots---undun">#14 The Roots - Undun</h2>

<p>The brilliance of <strong>The Roots</strong> 13th studio album is that it’s told backward to forward, hence <em>Undun</em>. Kind of like <strong>Nas’</strong> <em>Rewind</em>, and does share a similar-in-theme linear storyline (death, yo!). On first listen I didn’t realize the album was structured backwards, or realize it had a linear storyline. 
The story according to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqYFclG1hdw&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=SP0BC4629DFE5B9E52&amp;lf=list_related" title="Undun Story Roots Youtube">The Roots</a>
&gt;undun is an existential re-telling of the short life of one Redford Stephens (1974-1999). Through the use of emotives and Redford’s internal dialogues the album seeks to illustrate the intersection of free will and prescribed destiny as it plays out ‘on the corner’. Utilizing a reverse narrative arc, the album begins as the listener finds Redford disoriented–postmortem–and attempting to make sense of his former life. As he moves through its pivotal moments he begins to deconstruct all that has led to his (and our own) coming undun.</p>

<p><strong>Bilal Oliver</strong> gives a notable performance on <em>The Other Side</em>, and the rest of the album doesn’t come up short on guests. Some of the most interesting tracks on the album are the closing pieces (or opening pieces) because they’re classical compositions. It’s nice to see The Roots trying new things, even involving <strong>Sufjan Stevens</strong>. This is definitely their most well-crafted album in years.</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>Sleep, One Time, The Otherside, Stomp</em> and <em>I Remember</em>.</p>

<h2 id="tv-on-the-radio---nine-types-of-light">#13 TV On the Radio - Nine Types of Light</h2>

<p><em>Nine Types of Light</em> is another diverse record from <strong>Tunde</strong> and company. It’s full of music only they are capable of composing. The sound they’ve perfected over the years is so unique and far-reaching (accessible by the masses), that it’s hard to not like. You have dancey numbers like the opening <em>Second Song</em>, compelling ballads like <em>You</em> and the hit <em>Will Do</em>, to straight-up funky shit like <em>No Future Shock</em> or <em>New Cannonball Blues</em>, and borderline surfer-rock backing riffs in <em>Repetition</em>. TVotR are simply unparalleled in creating dense, layered, complex, and extremely catchy music. I’ve heard people say that Tunde channels <strong>Prince</strong>, and I don’t hold opposing contention.</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>You, Will Do, New Cannonball Blues</em> and <em>Forgotten</em>.</p>

<h2 id="sims---bad-time-zoo">#12 Sims - Bad Time Zoo</h2>

<p>It’s 2011 and we haven’t heard a follow-up record from <strong>Sims</strong> since 2005’s instant classic <em>Lights Out Paris</em>. <em>Bad Time Zoo</em> paints a more mature Sims, a less dark, less bleak Andrew Sims. A Sims who <em>loves his girl</em> (LMG) and isn’t shy to write a somewhat cheesy song about it. For the record, I still have a hard time with the chorus, but I give him props for such a bold move. <strong>Lazerbeak’s</strong> production is equally upbeat and positive (awesome), complimenting Sims’ optimism. Now don’t get me wrong, the album is not without its social commentary or notions on our adverse impact on the planet, but it’s overall more positive in theme. He advocates change, over complaining about how fucked up the world is. <strong>Bad Time Zoo</strong> is a strong sophomore record. I don’t necessarily love it as a whole, not like Lights Out Paris, but it’s a step in another direction, and I feel okay about that.</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>Future Shock, Burn It Down, When It Rolls In</em> and <em>Good Times</em>.</p>

<p>This record is simply straight-up fun. I love the psychedelic 70’s throwback rock vibe. Sure, <strong>Graveyard</strong> have less-than-cheery lyrics, but they’re extremely catchy, ass-shaking, and memorable. <em>No Good, Mr. Holden</em> was my “jam” for a few months this year (borderline obsession). These guys are definitely not treading new territory musically, but they know how to create damn fine records. I <em>really</em> love this record. I even gifted it to my father for Christmas. I hope he digs it as much as I do.  </p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>Ain’t Fit To Live Here, No Good, Mr Holden, Hisingen Blues</em> and <em>Uncomfortably Numb</em>.</p>

<p>I’m still waiting to hear word on Andy’s full-length collaboration record with <strong>P.O.S</strong>, but a full-length from him will do fine for now. <strong>Minneapolis</strong> now has the talented <strong>Astronautalis</strong> in its fair city, and I think that’s awesome. Andy’s vision as a musician is an odd one. I can’t say I’ve ever heard someone approach songwriting like he does. This makes his voice as an artist unique, and undoubtedly why I find him compelling. I’d describe his music as something more than spoken word, not really hip-hop, maybe some abstract off-kilter sans-tradition chaotic apocalyptic hip-hop mixed with a pop tinge. How’s that for genre whoring. Much of the aforementioned descriptions can be attributed to this dudes voice and delivery. I find myself off-put by his abrasiveness at times, not just his vocal approach, but the production. It’s crazy. Crazy <em>interesting</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>The River, The Woods, This is Our Science, Thomas Jefferson, Dimitri Mendeleev</em> and <em>Contrails</em>.</p>

<h2 id="loss---despond">#9 Loss - Despond</h2>

<p>This record is my pick for depressingly-crushing doom record of the year. It piqued my interest right away with the plain-spoken opening track <em>Weathering The Blight</em>. From there we have the cheerful <em>Open Veins To A Curtain Closed</em>, followed up with <em>Cut Up, Depressed And Alone</em>. Awesome song names? Sure. Does the album crush and fall from dense to airey melodic passages? Yes. Cool story, bro. If you like doom and/or depressing metal and haven’t listened to this, you should (you probably have).</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>ONE, Ambling Alp, Madder Red</em> and <em>Mondegreen</em>.</p>

<p>WitTR have been one of my favorite black metal acts for years. Their latest album does not disappoint. I could tell you that I’m a sucker for angelic female vocals, and that is the only reason this album makes the list. I <em>am&lt;/em a sucker for angelic female vocals, but this album *is</em> so much more than that.</p>

<p>As a side note, I find the band’s affinity for using vintage recording equipment to be paramount to my appreciation of them. At least, it’s one of the defining components I cherish about their music.</p>

<p>I’ve heard this may be their last black metal inspired album, and they may pursue straight-up folk music in the future. I’d like to hear that.</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>Thuja Magus Imperium, Subterranean Initiation, Astral Blood</em> and <em>Prayer Of Transformation</em>.</p>

<h2 id="doomtree---no-kings">#7 Doomtree - No Kings</h2>

<p>Home town pride right here. <strong>Doomtree</strong> have taken a big step with this record. Their approach to beat-making has evolved tremendously. The production on this is so massive, so dense, so unique. From <strong>Cecil Otter’s</strong> videogame soundtrackesque beats to <strong>Lazerbeak’s</strong> unfuckwitable lavabangers, this is all wins hands-down. If I had to poke holes in this solid sophomore record, I’d take issue with the “we rap better” lyrical theme on <em>Bangarang</em> and <em>Punch-Out</em>. I always hate it when rappers rap about rapping. I know that sounds ridiculous. But with lyrics like <em>“Doomtree bangarang/all these rappers sound the same/beats/sound the same/raps/sound the same/…/ten years in our lane”</em> and <em>“had to be crushing savagely/not your average everyday/nothing short of masterpiece”</em>, I have to stop and ask why Doomtree feels they need to write songs like this. I don’t want to hear rappers talk about being awesome at rapping. What the fuck does that even mean? I hate that kind of arrogant bravado. I expect more from Doomtree. I don’t even want them broaching the subject. I want them to win me over with their lyrics and wordplay, their substance, not how great they think they are or their opinions on other rappers. Leave it up to the listener to draw comparisons, to favor so-and-so rapper over another. Don’t talk to your audience about it. If I look hard at some of the lyrics on this record I’m somewhat disappointed. Great beats though.</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>Bolt Cutter, Beacon, Little Mercy, String Theory</em> and <em>Team The Best Team</em>.</p>

<p>So OFWGKTA might be a trending wetdream; stiff, crusted, an unwashed stain on the pants of teenagers everywhere. I don’t care about any of that. <strong>Frank Ocean</strong> has serious potential. Between him and <strong>Abel Tesfaye</strong>, fans of r&amp;b and soul music have a lot to look forward to. While Frank’s lyrics might not always be of the most thought-provoking or substantial variety, you can not deny this gentleman’s sense for melody and crafting beautiful songs. <em>We All Try</em> and <em>Strawberry Swing</em> are perfect examples of unconventional approaches to r&amp;b as a genre, and to music in general. The album is not without its misses, I’m definitely not a fan of the sample chosen for <em>American Wedding</em>, I can’t stand the <strong>Eagles</strong>. Nor do I care much for the lyrics in <em>Songs For Women</em>. I do absolutely adore <em>Lovecrimes</em> and <em>Swim Good</em> like whoa. They ooze dopeness all over my shoe, aforementioned stain notwithstanding. As a mixtape this record is something really special. I can’t wait to hear what Frank comes up with on his debut record.</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>Strawberry Swing, Novacane, Lovecrimes, Swim Good</em> and <em>Nature Feels</em>.</p>

<h2 id="drake---take-care">#5 Drake - Take Care</h2>

<p>People are <em>really</em> divided when it comes to <strong>Drake</strong>. For me, it comes down to whether I appreciate what he’s doing. I like to think I do. <em>Thank Me Later</em> and <em>Take Care</em> have been played more front-to-back than most albums (in steady rotation) over the past 2 years. That means there is something about his music I find incredibly fascinating. Somewhere between Drake’s one-liners, his overt bravado, lazy-calm-cool flow, effective-but-mediocre singing ability, and the cheesy romantic sentiments, I decided to keep listening. I haven’t really stopped. Not only do I find his delivery incredibly unique and awesome (e.g. <em>Headlines</em>, <em>Take Care</em>), it’s the production that I find myself being floored by. The spareness, and thought given to each song’s construction are too impressive to feel any other way about them. And again, while his lyrics are by no means deep or thought-provoking, he has this <em>quality</em> in his music that works.</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>Over My Dead Body, Headlines, Crew Love, Take Care, Marvins Room,</em> and <em>Look What You’ve Done</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/best-of-2011/4_tom-waits_bad-as-me.jpg" alt="#4 Tom Waits - Bad As Me" /></p>

<h2 id="tom-waits---bad-as-me">#4 Tom Waits - Bad As Me</h2>

<p>What can I say about <strong>Tom Waits</strong>? He is, in my opinion, one of the most (if not the most) important artists of all time. To say I love him would be an understatement. So on with the new record. <em>Chicago</em> is a fantastic album opener. This is a perfect example of Tom’s excellent storytelling ability. He has this unique way of transcending time in his music. Rather, his music both takes me back to a time I never lived, as well as being able to exist in the present. <em>Chicago</em> expresses the idea of hope for the future, <em>your</em> future. <em>“Maybe things will be better in Chicago”</em>. With that simple statement, he says a lot. I picture driving cross-country, maybe from California to Chicago. But I also picture a much older time, before the global acceptance of automobiles. I envision traveling by train to Chicago, filled with hope for unknown possibility. Anyway, yeah, that’s Chicago to me. One of Tom’s greatest strengths lies in knowing how much to reveal in simple words, and how much to leave up to the listener to interpret for themselves.</p>

<p><em>Raised Right Men</em> is a wobbled blues track with a solid groove. <em>Talking At The Same Time</em> is another favorite. Tom’s choice to harness the power of his falsetto is outstanding. I also adore the horns and creepy piano runs. Oh, and Marc Ribot’s signature guitar work. As always, Waits offers a diverse genre-spanning output of great songs. I adore the sentiment of <em>Face To The Highway</em>, the outlandishness of <em>Bad As Me</em>, the breath-taking romanticism of <em>Kiss Me</em>, the mortal heartbreak and triumphant joy of <em>Last Leaf</em>, and the overtly vulgar passion of <em>Hell Broke Luce</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>Chicago, Talking At The Same Time, Face To The Highway, Kiss Me</em> and <em>Hell Broke Luce</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-weeknd---house-of-balloons">#3 The Weeknd - House of Balloons</h2>

<p>What a voice. I know everyone has heard <em>High For This</em>, whether watching a sporting event or catching the last season of <strong>Entourage</strong>. The Weeknd’s debut album/mixtape has been in heavy rotation since my buddy Warny posted <a href="http://www.mrilightpainting.com/2011/04/the-light-up-playlist-the-weeknd-wtf-w-marc-maron/" title="MRI Lightpainting - This is a Happy House">this blog entry</a>. I thank him for calling attention to <strong>Abel Tesfaye</strong>.
This album had me from the ominous opening. Something about the eerie production and violent/suggestive lyrics being wrapped-up in a pretty falsetto package sat very well with me. Once I started listening to <em>House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls</em> I was sold. The production and his delivery are perfect. It takes a special talent to execute such a complicated and off-putting beat that actually works. Tesfaye skillfully riding and adjusting to said beat is nothing short of brilliant. Also, the <strong>Siouxsie and the Banshees</strong> hook is so dope.
Wicked Games is another well-executed track. The vocal delivery is outright angry, and forcefully emphasized in all the right places. The overtly sexual nature of <em>The Party &amp; The After Party</em> and <em>Loft Music</em> are presented in a soulful manner, but are <em>so</em> wrong. Some dirty stuff wrapped-up in a pretty package. Awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>High For This, House Of Balloons/Glass Table Girls, Wicked Games, The Party &amp; The After Party, * and *Loft Music</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve written about <strong>James Blake</strong> a <a href="/music/reviews/2011/02/13/james-blake-self-titled-album-review/" title="James Blake Self-Titled Album Review" class="external">few</a> <a href="/music/2011/09/29/james-blake-live-at-first-avenue-92811/" title="James Blake Live at First Avenue" class="external">times</a> this year. I’m not sure I have anything more to say. This record is fantastic. He deserves all the praise. Oh, that EP he released <strong>Enough Thunder</strong> turned out to be awesome too.</p>

<h2 id="bon-iver---bon-iver">#1 Bon Iver - Bon Iver</h2>

<p>I imagine this record is on many folks favorite end-of-year lists. It may even be number one (sup, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/8727-the-top-50-albums-of-2011/5/" title="Pitchfork's Top 50 of 2011">Pitchfork</a>). <strong>Justin Vernon</strong> came back from an absolute masterpiece of an album, in <em>For Emma, Forever Ago</em>, and blew everyone away all over again. This record is <em>so</em> good it’s hard to praise in an effective manner. The fact is, he composes intricate, refreshing, and emotionally compelling music. This album has so much going on, while <em>For Emma</em> was stripped-down and intimate, this is so full, so densely layered. It’s a lot to take in.</p>

<p>While his lyrics might not make sense in a traditional sense (I’m sensing a theme in my list this year), they always make a profound statement, emotionally. His music takes me on a journey. Man, that sounds cheesy. It’s true, cheese-factor aside. This album is so much about places, and how you <em>feel</em> in a given place. It is a flat-out gorgeous record.</p>

<p>I’ve always been someone who reacts passionately to music that exhibits conviction. Whether that be in musicianship, lyrics, or overall tone. <strong>Bon Iver</strong> effectively demolishes the sappiness in me.</p>

<p><strong>Stand-out tracks include:</strong> <em>The entire album. Yes, even the album closer, it’s epic!</em>.</p>
